    "content": "# May a Jew live in a town with no other Jews?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>Are there any Halachot pertaining to a Jew living in a community with no other Jews? Is it permitted for a Jew to live in such a community?  I need sources! </p>\n\n<p>I'm not talking about keeping kosher and observant.  I'm talking about physically living where there are no other Jews and perhaps with family that is not Jewish.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>It seems that halachically this isn't a problem. Chaba\"d <em>shlichim</em> (emissaries) go to places that have no Jews and start a Chaba\"d. Rav Binyamin Kamenetzki, a\"h was encouraged by his father (Rav Ya'akov, a\"h) to start a new Jewish community in Long Island. (My understanding from speaking to him is that there were NO Jews when he first developed his yeshiva. There were a few in a neighboring community.) </p>\n\n<p>However,  I think you can learn an excellent example from Kinyan Torah (Aka, 6th \"chapter\" of \"Pirkei Avot\") Mishnah 9. Rav Yose ben Kisma makes it clear that a person should live only in a place that has Torah, and should not be lured to live in any other place even if offered astounding wealth. In other words, it doesn't appear to be encouraged, if one has a choice.</p>\n\n<p>On the other hand, Hillel, in <em>Pirkei Avot</em> 2:5 says that \"In a place where there are no men, strive to be a man.\" I.e., that <strong><em>might</em></strong> imply that if you think you can establish a Jewish community somewhere, you should try to do so.</p>\n\n\n",

Or did he forfeit them because he was estranged from the family?</p>\n\n<p>I know that the law of the double portion came later, but as always, we hear Avraham Avinu knew Torah, read Torah, learned Torah, and so, I am just wondering.</p>\n\n<p>Where is there in Rabbinic sources, inclusive of Midrashim, a discussion, to whom if anyone did Abraham give a double portion? </p>\n\n<p>Devarim 21:17\nכִּי אֶת-הַבְּכֹר בֶּן-הַשְּׂנוּאָה יַכִּיר, לָתֶת לוֹ פִּי שְׁנַיִם, בְּכֹל אֲשֶׁר-יִמָּצֵא, לוֹ:  כִּי-הוּא רֵאשִׁית אֹנוֹ, לוֹ מִשְׁפַּט הַבְּכֹרָה.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 5)\n\n<p>The verses strongly indicate that not only did Avraham not give a double portion to Yishmael, he gave (basically) everything to Yitshak.</p>\n\n<p>For example, right before stating that Avraham died, Genesis (25:5) states that he gave all of his possessions to Yitshak:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>וַיִּתֵּ֧ן אַבְרָהָ֛ם אֶת־כָּל־אֲשֶׁר־ל֖וֹ לְיִצְחָֽק </p>\n  \n  <p>And Avraham gave all he had to Yitshak.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The only exception to this listed is that he gave gifts to the children of the concubines (25:6):</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>וְלִבְנֵ֤י הַפִּֽילַגְשִׁים֙ אֲשֶׁ֣ר לְאַבְרָהָ֔ם נָתַ֥ן אַבְרָהָ֖ם מַתָּנֹ֑ת </p>\n  \n  <p>And to the children of the concubines that Avraham had, Avraham gave gifts.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>This seems to be consistent with Sarah's declaration (Genesis 21:10) that Yishmael would not inherit together with Yitshak.</p>\n\n<p>Indeed, the Midrash (Genesis Rabba 61:7) illustrates the descendants of Yishmael claiming their unfulfilled due for the double portion, as the \"son of the despised wife\", whereupon they are told that Avraham chose to give everything to Yitshak. This affirms the implication that he did not give a double portion to Yishmael.</p>\n\n<p>Although Avraham's division of his assets is listed before his death,  the placement of those verses right before his death indicates that he allotted all of his possessions right before his death, and possibly distributed them. The gifts are thus not necessarily identical with the post-death distribution, but are related. The Midrash addresses the post death double portion, and indeed, conflates it with the verse about giving everything to Yitshak. This indicates that the Midrash too understood that either the verse refers to the division after his death, or that he dived everything up before his death.</p>\n\n<p>In the same vein, R. Eliyahu Mizrahi (Genesis 24:10) understands based on Genesis (25:5) that he left everything to Yitshak. He asks how Avraham could have ignored Yishmael, according to the Midrashim that he kept the Torah, as he should have given Yishmael the double portion. He suggests that Avraham did so on the basis of the verse (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Genesis.21.12?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">21:12</a>):</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>כִּ֣י בְיִצְחָ֔ק יִקָּרֵ֥א לְךָ֖ זָֽרַע </p>\n  \n  <p>For it is through Isaac that offspring shall be continued for you.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Indicating that Yitshak; not Yishamel, was the rightful heir.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chaim_Paltiel_(Paltiel_of_Falaise)\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">R. Hayyim Paltiel</a> (25:6) asks the question as well, and answers that either Avraham transferred his possessions before his death, so he avoided the requirement to bequeath a double portion to Yishmael, or he based himself on the verse declaring Yitshak his rightful heir. Alternatively, he suggests that both Avraham and Yishamel were considered converts who sever their legal relationships with one another, so he was not obligated to leave him a double portion.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://he.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D7%99%D7%A9%D7%A9%D7%9B%D7%A8_%D7%91%D7%A8_%D7%90%D7%99%D7%99%D7%9C%D7%A0%D7%91%D7%95%D7%A8%D7%92\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">R.

This is similar to the <em>gifts</em> given to the children of Keturah before Avraham died. Note, that this occurred when Yishmael was about 15 or so, while he did maintain ties with Avraham and his family.</p>\n\n<p>Rashi <a href=\"http://www.chabad.org/library/bible_cdo/aid/8217#v=3&showrashi=true\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Vayeira 22:3</a> shows that 35 years later Yishmael was with him when he took Yizchak to the Akeidah</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><strong>his two young men:</strong> Ishmael and Eliezer, for a person of esteem is not permitted to go out on the road without two men, so that if one\n  must ease himself and move to a distance, the second one will remain\n  with him. — [from Pirkei d’Rabbi Eliezer, ch. 31; Gen.

Rabbi Yecheskel Feinhandler in his Ginzei Kodesh pg. 107:13 writes that a box that is used to transport seforim certainly does not need genizah(Rav Eliyashiv and Rav Nissim Karelitz). However, a cardboard box that holds the actual seforim will depend on what its use is for. If it is a flimsy box that is just to hold them together, then they can be thrown out. A cardboard box which is used and not thrown out for a very long time is considered to be a tashmish of kedusha and should be put in genizah. </p>\n\n<p>However, in a case where the box is made to look nice it could be that one would need to put it in genizah. In conclusion, it seems that the main determining factor is if one uses cardboard box for a while after purchasing or not. If right after they buy the seforim and don't want the box then they can throw it out(maybe even a nice box). However,if one leaves them in the box then one makes them into a tashmish kedusha and would require genizah. See footnotes 34 and 35 for the whole discussion.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Why isn't imitating Hashem's traits a constant mitzvah?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>In the <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Sefer_HaChinukh,_Opening_Letter_by_the_Author.3\" rel=\"noreferrer\">introduction to Sefer HaChinuch</a>, the author delineates what he feels are six constant mitzvos from the 613.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>מששה מצות מהן שחיובן תמידי לא יפסק מעל האדם אפי' רגע בכל ימיו. ואלו הם. א' להאמין בשם. ב' שלא להאמין לזולתו. ג' ליחדו. ד' לאהבה אותו. ה' ליראה אותו. ו' שלא לתור אחר מחשבת הלב וראיית העינים. </p>\n  \n  <p>From them are six mitzvos that their obligation is constant; a person shouldn't desist from them for even a moment their entire life. And they are: 1) to believe in Hashem 2) to not believe in another deity 3) to unify Him 4)  to love Him 5) to fear Him 6) not to stray after the thoughts of our hearts or the sight of our eyes.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I suppose there are others one could ask from, but the mitzvah of והלכת בדרכיו, that we should imitate Hashem's traits, seems to me to be a constant mitzvah. The Chinuch himself in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Sefer_HaChinukh,_.611.1\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Mitzvah 611</a> writes:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>מצוה ללכת ולהדמות בדרכי השם יתברך - שנצטוינו לעשות <strong>כל מעשינו</strong> בדרך הישר והטוב בכל כחנו, ולהטות <strong>כל דברינו</strong> אשר בינינו ובין זולתנו, על דרך החסד והרחמים</p>\n  \n  <p>It is a Mitzvah to walk and resemble the ways of the Holy Blessed one - as we are commanded to perform <strong>all actions</strong> in a manner of goodness and integrity with all our strength. To turn aside <strong>all our words</strong> that are between us and beside us, towards of kindness and compassion</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>It sounds like everything a person does has to be acting like the traits of Hashem. Now I admit most of his list seem to be \"deos\", mindsets, yet the last one can be related to actions just like Mitzvah 611. In <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Sefer_HaChinukh,_.387.1\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Mitzvah 387</a> the Chinuch writes:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>שלא לתור אחר מחשבת הלב וראית העינים...שלא ירדף האדם אחר מראה עיניו, ובכלל זה שלא נרדף אחר תאוות העולם הזה, ...וזהו שאמרו זכרונם לברכה (ברכות יב, ב) ולא תתורו אחרי לבבכם זו מינות, ואחרי עיניכם זו זנות</p>\n  \n  <p>We are not to follow the whims of our heart and the lusts of our eyes...Similarly, a person should not pursue the things that one sees, principally meaning earthly desires, ...The Sages expressed this in their statement (Berachot 12b), \"'Do not stray after your hearts' refers to apostasy. 'After your eyes' refers to licentiousness.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>To me, \"pursuing\" includes actions, not just thoughts. (Note the gemarra we have mentions only <em>thoughts</em> of licentiousness, but the <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Sefer_HaMitzvot_LaRambam,_Mitzvot_Lo_Taase.47.1\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Rambam</a> quotes the Sifrei that has the girsa the Chinuch quotes, just licentiousness, and it could be what the Chinuch really quoting). One could maybe argue that who says a person has to do anything at all? But I feel like people are constantly thinking, and it's possible to think in ways that aren't in line with this mitzvah. I don't know if it's mentioned that the mitzvah applies to thoughts, but it would make sense to me.</p>\n\n<p>Bottom line: Why didn't the Chinuch include this?</p>\n\n\n",

Maybe there some other meanings that fit with the prefix Bet, but I wondered why the word בו is translated as 'over it', does the letter bet as a prefix also carries the meaning 'over' ?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>This is more of a Hebrew grammar question than anything else, but there are at least ten different meanings that this particular particle (represented by the letter, <em>bet</em>) might have:</p>\n\n<p>1) Spatial - ie: \"in\", \"at\", or \"on\" a place. For example, Genesis 31:54 - ויזבח יעקב זבח בהר (\"Then Jacob offered a sacrifice <em>on</em> the mountain\");</p>\n\n<p>2) Temporal - ie: a point in time when an action takes place. For example, Genesis 30:14 - בימי קציר חטים (\"<em>in</em> the days of wheat harvest\");</p>\n\n<p>3) Instrumental - ie: an inanimate object used to perform an action. For example, Exodus 22:23 - והרגתי אתכם בחרב (\"and I will kill you <em>with</em> the sword\");</p>\n\n<p>4) Adversative - ie: a relationship of disadvantage. For example, Genesis 16:12 - ידו בכל ויד כל בו (\"his hand will be <em>against</em> everyone and everyone's hand <em>against</em> him\");</p>\n\n<p>5) Specification - ie: clarifying an immediately preceding action. For example, Genesis 7:21 - ויגוע כל בשר הרמש על הארץ בעוף ובבהמה ובחיה ובכל השרץ (\"and all flesh died that moved on the earth - birds, cattle, wild animals, all swarming creatures\");</p>\n\n<p>6) Causal - ie: a cause or reason for something. For example, Deuteronomy 24:16 - איש בחטאו יומתו (\"each person shall be put to death <em>because of</em> his own sin\");</p>\n\n<p>7) Accompaniment - ie: denoting circumstances that occur together with something else. For example, Genesis 39:9 - באשר את אשתו (\"<em>because</em> you are his wife\");</p>\n\n<p>8) Essence - ie: marking the identity of a noun. For example, Genesis 1:26 - נעשה אדם בצלמנו (\"let us make man <em>in</em> our image\");</p>\n\n<p>9) Manner - ie: as an adverb, describing the way that an action is performed. For example, לך בשלום (\"go <em>peaceably</em>\");</p>\n\n<p>10) Price - ie: indicating the cost of something. For example, Genesis 23:9 - בכסף מלא יתננה לי (\"let him give it to me <em>at the cost of</em> full silver\").</p>\n\n<p>For more information, see Bill T. Arnold and John H. Choi, <em>A Guide to Biblical Hebrew Syntax</em> (Cambridge University Press, 2003), 102-106.</p>\n\n<p>Your example (תמשול־בו), is like #4 above: an adversative use of the particle. Such usages are common, and are found throughout Tanakh.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>I will first show how Rav Hirsch explains the meaning of <em>תמשול בו</em> and then contrast it with תמלך על to show the difference between them and the reason for it. I will also explain the reason for the particular pasuk that you reference.</p>\n\n<p>Rav Hirsch translates <em>תמשול בו</em> as <em>master it</em>, he then explains that</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>So that in truth the relationship between Man and his passions should\n  be essentially not unlike that between husband and wife. A Man should\n  be freely affianced to his sensuality, so as, under his guidance,\n  together with it, to achieve the highest purpose of life.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Note what Hashem tells Chava in <a href=\"http://www.chabad.org/library/bible_cdo/aid/8167/jewish/Chapter-3.htm#v=16&showrashi=true\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Bereishis 3:16</a></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>אֶל־הָֽאִשָּׁ֣ה אָמַ֗ר הַרְבָּ֤ה אַרְבֶּה֙ עִצְּבוֹנֵ֣ךְ וְהֵֽרֹנֵ֔ךְ\n  בְּעֶ֖צֶב תֵּֽלְדִ֣י בָנִ֑ים וְאֶל־אִישֵׁךְ֙ תְּשׁ֣וּקָתֵ֔ךְ וְה֖וּא\n  יִמְשָׁל־בָּֽךְ:</p>\n  \n  <p>To the woman He said, \"I shall surely increase your sorrow and your\n  pregnancy; in pain you shall bear children. And to your husband will\n  be your desire, and he will rule over you.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Rav Hirsch also connects this with משל.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>basic meaning: to declare what something is and should be, to give its\n  character and designation. Hence, to command, to rule. The משל\n  directs everyone what he is to be and do. So that it is by no means\n  synonymous with כבש, to force to subjugate, it is rather to guide and\n  rule.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Thus one establishes the correct character and meaning of a relationship <strong>within</strong> the party being <em>ruled</em>. This usage is why the בו is used here as well as why בָּֽךְ is used with Chava.</p>\n\n<p>Note that in <a href=\"http://www.chabad.org/library/bible_cdo/aid/8232#v=8&showrashi=true\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Vayeishev 37:8</a> the two terms are contrasted.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>וַיֹּ֤אמְרוּ לוֹ֙ אֶחָ֔יו הֲמָלֹ֤ךְ תִּמְלֹךְ֙ עָלֵ֔ינוּ אִם־מָשׁ֥וֹל\n  תִּמְשֹׁ֖ל בָּ֑נוּ וַיּוֹסִ֤פוּ עוֹד֙ שְׂנֹ֣א אֹת֔וֹ עַל־חֲלֹֽמֹתָ֖יו\n  וְעַל־דְּבָרָֽיו:</p>\n  \n  <p>So his brothers said to him, \"Will you reign over us, or will you\n  govern us?\" And they continued further to hate him on account of his\n  dreams and on account of his words.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Rav Hirsch translates the two terms for ruling as</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Wouldst thou indeed be a King over us, or indeed now rule over us</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The first term, מלך על, implies the force of כבוש over one imposed from outside, while the term משול ב means have us accept you as the ruler internally so that you are the <em>legitimate</em> and accepted ruler. This is the difference in modern terms between the dictator of North Korea, or the mullahs of Iran and the President of the United States or the Queen of England.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>R' Yehudah ibn Tibbon, one of the great translators, laid out the rules for translating in the preface to his translation of <a href=\"https://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=41644&st=&pgnum=5&hilite=\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Chovos Halevavos</a>. The translator must</p>\n<ul>\n<li>know the language of the original book</li>\n<li>The language he is translating into</li>\n<li>and understand the content</li>\n</ul>\n<p>This way, he can adapt from one language to another without creating confusion by being excessively literal (like Amelia Bedelia).

I was wondering if anyone had experience building one from scratch using stuff from a local Lowes or Home Depot. I was going to use PVC piping but that sways and isn't so steady with winds we sometimes get. \nI basically want to make a sukkah that looks like the ones from a kit but without spending hundreds of dollars. </p>\n\n<p>I can get tarps for the walls, zip ties to attach the poles to the tarps... I just need to figure out how to get the poles and have them stick together.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 6)\n\n<p>I doubt that it's possible to recreate a kit-like metal sukka frame without spending hundreds of dollars, at least not without creative sourcing of the materials (e.g. finding them in a junk yard, or something).</p>\n\n<p>A few years ago, I bought raw materials to extend an existing round-aluminum-tube-based kit I had (not like the newfangled kits with rectangle-cross-sectioned poles). I shopped around, and the best source I found for the tubes was <a href=\"http://metalsdepot.com\" rel=\"noreferrer\">http://metalsdepot.com</a>. So let's take a look at their prices to get a ballpark estimate for the poles.</p>\n\n<p>To match my kit, I ordered <a href=\"https://www.metalsdepot.com/products/alum2.phtml?page=rndtube&LimAcc=%20&aident=\" rel=\"noreferrer\">6061 Aluminum Round Tube</a> with an outer diameter of 1\" and an inner diameter of .75\". Other specifications may work, too, but unless you know how to do the engineering, I'd recommend against skimping on the thickness. Let's say you want to make a 6' cube without any horizontal or vertical members in the middles; that'll require 12 6' poles. The price at Metals Depot right now for those 12 tubes is $262. I'm not sure what the right dimensions of <a href=\"https://www.metalsdepot.com/products/alum2.phtml?page=tube&LimAcc=%20&aident=\" rel=\"noreferrer\">6063 Aluminum Square Tube</a> would be, but the comparable size there costs $253 for 12.</p>\n\n<p>Add to that 8 connectors for the corners. I don't have handy records of which ones I used or how much they cost, but I suspect that 8 of them will probably cost around $100 or more. Note that these are pretty heavy-duty metal devices.</p>\n\n<p>I conclude that the cost of new raw materials for a normal-sized metal sukka frame probably starts at at least $300 and hoes up from there with size and complexity.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>Here's the sukkah I used to use until I got a dedicated sukkah deck.</p>\n\n<p>Frame:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>The frame is made of <a href=\"http://www.homedepot.com/p/3-4-in-EMT-Conduit-101550/100400406\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">3/4\" EMT conduit</a>.

A fruit\n  pie is a Mezonos because it is a dessert item, while calzones are\n  often intended to be the main meal and not dessert. Although the Taz\n  (168:20) rules that the bracha on calzones is Mezonos, the Shulchan\n  Aruch (168:17), and Mishna Berura (168:94) rule that the bracha is\n  Hamotzi. However, the Biur Halacha states that many Achronim agree\n  with the Taz, and if the calzone is clearly not meant as a main-meal\n  type of food, the bracha is definitely Mezonos. Rav Belsky, zt”l said\n  that it is unclear whether pizza is a snack or meal food, but noted\n  that the general custom is to say Mezonos when eating a small amount.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>In view of what DoubleAA mentioned in the comment above, my thinking is that calzones are usually eaten as a meal, and I think that would, thus, qualify it as <em>Hamotzi</em>. This is an area to ask your rav. I'd like to know his answer. I'm hoping that the answer is <strong>not</strong> \"I'm not sure.

The first ingredient is coconut meat.

For a similar ruling regarding applesauce, see, e.g. <a href=\"https://oukosher.org/guide-to-blessings/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Apple Sauce | Shehakol | Borei Nefashot | Shehakol is to be said if the apples are totally pureed. This applies mostly to commercially available canned or bottled apple sauce. However, Ha-aytz applies for homemade apple sauce where the applesauce is chunky. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>However, according to many rabbinic opinions the correct blessing is actually <em>haeitz</em> or even <em>ha'adama</em>.  See, e.g., <a href=\"http://halachipedia.com/index.php?title=Processed_fruits_and_vegetables\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Halachipedia's article on the topic</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>If one grinds a vegetable or fruit, whether or not one cooks it, if the vegetable is still recognizable in the product then the Bracha is the same the vegetable, however if it’s ground and unrecognizable then the Bracha is shehakol. According to Sephardic practice, the Bracha does not change, even if the fruit is unrecognizable. Some Ashkenazi poskim maintain that the Bracha for tree-fruits becomes Ha'adama, but the Bracha for vegetables remains the same...</p>\n  \n  <p>The Gemara Brachot 38a concludes that the Bracha for Tarima (processed dates) is HaEtz because the actual fruit remains. Rashi (D”H Tarima) explains that Tarima is dates which were crushed but not pulverized. However, Rambam (Brachot 8:4) explains that even if one removed the pits and crushed it and kneaded it into a dough the Bracha would still be HaEtz. The S”A 202:7 rules like the Rambam and the Rama rules like Rashi. Yalkut Yosef 202:22 and Halacha Brurah 202:25 rule like Shulchan Aruch, that even if the fruit or vegetable is completely pulverized, the Bracha does not change.</p>\n  \n  <p>The Mishna Brurah 208:42 concludes that whenever the fruit is recognizable (because of the form and texture) the Bracha would be like the fruit, however, when it’s so processed that it’s not recognizable the bracha is Shehakol. Vezot HaBracha (pg 100, chapter 12) and Veten Bracha (Halachos of Brochos by Rabbi Bodner pg 403-4, chapter 22) agree.</p>\n  \n  <p>However, the Laws of Brachos (Rabbi Forst, pg 303-5) explains the Mishna Brurah as saying that even for an unrecognizable pulp one should make the bracha of the original fruit. Only something which completely lost it's solid form is shehakol. He therefore writes that apple sauce is HaEtz, and mashed potatoes and peanut butter are HaAdama.</p>\n  \n  <p>Rabbi Hershel Schachter in Brachot Ha'nehenin (31:15) quotes an alternative approach from Rabbi Soloveitchik; Rosh (Brachot 6:18) writes that for the Bracha of Ha'adama, it is unnecessary for the vegetable to be recognizable. For example, the Bracha for a vegetable broth would be Ha'adama, even though the vegetables were strained out. However, he is unsure if the same rule applies to strained fruit soup. Therefore, Rabbi Soloveitchik felt that it would be preferable to recite Ha'adama on mashed fruits - like applesauce - since Ha'adama is more specific than Shehakol, and Ha'adama doesn't require tzurat ha'pri. Likewise, the Bracha for mashed vegetables would remain Ha'adama. Rabbi Schachter personally follows this opinion (See OU Document X-18 and HalachaDoc LG-A9). </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>According to all authorities, the blessing after eating an olive-sized amount in the requisite time would be <em>borei nefashot</em>.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: -1)\n\n<p>Since the <a href=\"https://thrivemarket.com/thrive-market-organic-original-coconut-wraps\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">ingredients to these coconut wraps</a> are: </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Organic Coconut Meat, Organic Coconut Water, Organic Extra Virgin Coconut Oil</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I believe the bracha would be ha'eitz which would make the bracha afterwards borei nefashos.</p>\n\n<p>See <a href=\"http://berachot.org/foods/letter_c.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a> where you can see that the bracha on coconut meat including shredded coconut is ha'eitz.</p>\n\n\n",

Another example is whether upon becoming thirteen years of age they are permitted to read from the Torah (Bet Av vol. 6 §4). Or, if their Kiddushin is valid or not. </p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: -2)\n\n<p>The simple answer is no. Mentally disabled or ill people are usually considered \"Shotim\" <em>(plural of \"Shoteh\", a loose translation is a fool - in the sense that they are not in control of their actions)</em> in the halacha and they can't join a minyan as they are exempt of the mandatory mitzvot (\"Patur me'mitzvot\" in the halacha).</p>\n\n<p>Most mentally ill people are considered \"Shotim\".\nMentally disabled people with a level of comprehension of less than a 6-year-old's are exempt as well.\nIf their level is that of a 6-year-old, they have to abide the mitzvot they understand.

He wasn't involved in the war right? </p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=9597&st=&pgnum=188\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Ohr Hachayim</a> explains that the purpose of the interruption of the story of Malki Tzedek placed immediately after stating that the King of Sedom went to see Avram is to emphasize and praise the merits of <em>tzadikim</em> (righteous people).</p>\n\n<p>The contrast is that the wicked King of Sedom came to Avram empty handed. Being a king, he was wealthy enough to at least offer Avram some type of gift. In contrast, Malki Tzedek, who had no obligation to Avram at all greeted Avram with bread and wine.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>Rav Hirsch points out that the king of S'dom, who had been saved by Avraham refused to acknowledge the good that he had done and what thanks he owed him. He instead tried to buy his position back. This shows the character traits that caused the destruction of the five cities.</p>\n<p>Melchizedek, on the other hand, came to acknowledge the miracle that Hashem had performed for Avraham and to thank him and bless him for putting himself at risk. He also came to show the appropriate hospitality to the weary warriors.</p>\n<p>Even after Melchizedek comes to thank Avraham and to refresh the weary warriors, the King of S'dom takes the wrong idea and thinks that Avraham can be bribed into giving him his <em>due</em>. The sentence after, shows that he totally does not understand the idea of הכרת הטוב, gratitude.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.chabad.org/library/bible_cdo/aid/8209#v=17&showrashi=true\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Lech Lecha 14:17-18</a></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>These two verses show a striking contrast. The King of Sodom, who must\nhave felt very humiliated, and still more deeply indebted towards\nAbraham, not only allowed him to undertake the pursuit alone with his\nlittle band without joining him, but after the victory had been won,\ncomes out to meet him entirely as a King, thinks it is already a\nsufficient honour for Abraham to be met on equal terms as King to King\n\"in the valley שוה\". And still he comes to beg. To ask for favours, to\n\"demand\", is what a King of Sodom understands, but to refresh the worn\nout, famished victors with a piece of bread, with a drink of wine,\ndoes not enter the head, forms no part of the code of manners of His\nMajesty of Sodom! On the other hand, Melchizedek, King of Salem, who\nreally had nothing to do with the affair, had bread and wine brought\nout, but then he was also a priest to the Highest God. So that even\namongst the polytheistic nations the conception of an All-highest God,\nאלוקא דאלוהא, a God of gods had not become entirely lost.</p>\n<p>...</p>\n<p>But even so, here at once, two points become evident. (a) where this\nGod does hold sway the place became שלם, a home of peace and\nsalvation, (b) is conditional on צדק, on justice, righteousness, on\nthe just moral behavior of men.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>It's to show that the spiritual world expands beyond Abraham's world. Also,  Melchizedek could've been reminding Abraham - \"give and take with allies, but don't take anything from your enemies\".</p>\n<p>Melchizedek was an ally. Melchizedek recognized that God helped out Abraham. But what kind of religion does Melchizedek practice? We don't know. But Melchizedek is a priest of God and he is able to see that God was with Abraham.</p>\n<p>It's possible that Melchizedek was a mentor or guide for Abraham. Hence why Abraham gave him a tithe.</p>\n<p>Many people have a mentor priest:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Jethro the Midianite Priest gives advice to Moses in Exodus 18.</li>\n<li>The High Priest Eleazar helps Joshua.</li>\n<li>The priest of Bethel helps to guide the people of Samaria. 2 Kings 17:28</li>\n<li>Elijah mentors Elisha.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Now, one might become a conspiracy theorist and claim a heretical view that Melchizedek's priesthood is superior to the Levite priesthood. Not so!\nAbraham and his lineage continued where Melchizedek's priesthood left off.</p>\n<p>The first official priests of \"Jerusalem\" are \"Zadok\" and \"Ahimelech\". The roots of all three relate to Melchizedek of Salem. Hence, they are continuing the mysterious priesthood of Melchizedek. Melchizedek's priesthood is not superior to the Levite priesthood.</p>\n<p>Melchizedek represented the old priesthood of Canaan that went astray and had to be wiped out. However, Melchizedek was righteous and had a special relationship with God. Hence why Melchizedek was able to see that God was with Abraham.</p>\n\n\n",

Are these a form of <em>nevu'ah</em> meaning that G-d told him these things and now he is relaying it?</p>\n\n<p>Additionally, in the Behukotai <em>tochacha</em>, we find interspersed a few verses of hope and encouragement such as <a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=14081&st=&pgnum=393&hilite=\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Vayikra 26:42</a>. (Related that this is \"encouragement is Kitzur S.A.'s halacha that the Torah reader should raise his voice for this verse.) <em>Ki Tavo</em> has no words of encouragement in the middle.

Rav Yosha\n  Baer answers that in fact the Tochacha in Ki Savo also ends with\n  consolation… except the consolation only appears in Parshas Netzavim:\n  “And it shall come to pass, when all these things are come upon you,\n  the blessing and the curse, that I have presented before you – then\n  you will take it to your heart among all the nations where Hashem,\n  your G-d, has dispersed you. And you will return unto Hashem, your\n  G-d, and listen to His voice, according to everything that I command\n  you today, you and your children, with all your heart and all your\n  soul. [Devorim 30:1-2] The consolation is that at the end of all the\n  punishment and suffering, the Jewish people will do Teshuva [repent]\n  and return to G-d.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>This still leaves the question as to why the delay until Nitzavim. R\nexplains that the Rav Soloveitchik explains that the tochacha in\nBechukosai foretells the destruction of the first Bais Hamikdash, whose\nexile was foretold to be 70 years. The destruction of the Second\nTemple, foretold in Ki Savo caused our current exile, which will end\nat some point, but we cannot know when that will be.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>But the question can still be asked: Why is it that in the Tochacha in\n  Devorim, there is a pause and we have to “wait for the consolation”,\n  so to speak, while in the Tochacha in Bechukosai, the consolation\n  comes immediately? Rav Soloveitchik answers this question by\n  explaining that there is a fundamental difference between the two\n  Tochachas. The Ramba”n says that the Tochacha in Bechukosai foretells\n  and refers to the period of the destruction of the First Bais\n  HaMikdash and the exile from the Land of Israel at that time. The\n  Tochacha foretold in Ki Savo refers to the destruction of the Second\n  Bais HaMikdash and the exile that occurred at that time. The\n  Destruction of the First Bais HaMikdash and the Babylonian exile which\n  followed it had a prophesized finite end to it. The prophets foretold\n  that the people would be in exile for 70 years and indeed following\n  this 70 year period, the Jews were given permission to return to the\n  Land of Israel (where they eventually rebuilt the Bais HaMikdash).\n  Therefore, it makes sense that the Tochacha which foretells the\n  Babylonian Exile features the consolation in close proximity to the\n  end of the pasukim of chastisement.</p>\n  \n  <p>As we now know, we do not know of a specified date for the redemption\n  from the Destruction of the Second Bais HaMikdash. We have now been in\n  this exile for close to 2000 years! However, there will be an end to\n  this exile. As the Rambam writes in the Laws of Repentance: “Israel\n  will only be redeemed through repentance. The prophets have already\n  promised that the Jews will repent at the end of their exile and\n  immediately thereafter they will be redeemed, as it is written…” (and\n  then the Rambam quotes the pasuk in this week’s parsha) “…And it will\n  be that when all these things come upon you… you will return unto\n  Hashem your G-d.”</p>\n  \n  <p>When will that occur? We do not know, but it will come. This is\n  precisely why the consolation does not immediately follow the Tochacha\n  here in Devorim. We need to wait. We need to wait until we return to\n  the L-rd our G-d. We are going to be in the mess in which we find\n  ourselves until we do Teshuva.</p>\n  \n  <p>This is the difference between the two Tochachas. In the first, we\n  just had to wait a (relatively) short time. When the clock struck 70,\n  we were able to go home. The current exile is not like that.\n  Eventually, we will get out of it because “in the end Israel will\n  repent and immediately thereafter they will be redeemed” but we do not\n  know when that is going to happen.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

Kook did not want to perform the honour related mitsvot simultaneously, as per the rule <em>ein ossin mitsvot havilot havilot</em>)</p>\n\n<p>However, the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minchat_Chinuch\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Minhat Hinukh</a> (257) writes that a female scholar is not included in these rules, since she is not commanded to study Torah:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>אינן מצווה נ\"פ דאין להם דין חכם לכל הענינים שמוזהרים על כבוד חכמים ופשוט </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Additionally, the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yosef_Hayyim\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Ben Ish Hai</a> (Year 2 Parashat Ki Tetse 16) notes that one can infer from Sha'ar HaMitsvot (Parashat Kedoshim) of R. Hayyim Vital, that one need not stand for a female scholar.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://he.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D7%93%D7%95%D7%93_%D7%94%D7%9B%D7%94%D7%9F_%D7%A1%D7%A7%D7%9C%D7%99\" rel=\"noreferrer\">R.

    "content": "# How come a rape is considered a damage but not a crime in Judaism?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>In our Western (Goyish) culture, rape constitutes a serious criminal offense (up to 15 years inside), that is probably based on a Pshat of <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Deuteronomy.22.26?lang=he&with=all&lang2=he\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Deu 22, 26</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>וְלַנַּעֲרָה לֹא־תַעֲשֶׂה דָבָר אֵין לַנַּעֲרָה חֵטְא מָוֶת כִּי<br>\n  כַּאֲשֶׁר יָקוּם אִישׁ עַל־רֵעֵהוּ וּרְצָחוֹ נֶפֶשׁ כֵּן הַדָּבָר הַזֶּה׃ </p>\n  \n  <p>for as when a man riseth against his neighbor, and slayeth him, even so, is this matter [a rape of an engaged girl].\" </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Rashi: \"כִּי אֲנוּסָה הִיא וּבְחָזְקָה עָמַד עָלֶיהָ, כְּאָדָם הָעוֹמֵד עַל חֲבֵרוֹ לְהָרְגוֹ. \"</p>\n\n<p>How come that the Torah compares rape to a murder, but in the Halacha, there's no punishment for this crime?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>Usually, negative prohibitions carry a penalty of lashes. In this case, there is no punishment of lashes, because no prohibition has a penalty of both lashes and money (e.g. in <a href=\"http://beta.hebrewbooks.org/shas.aspx?mesechta=25&daf=4b&format=pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Makot 4b</a>; as DoubleAA noted, there is one exception, which is slandering a virgin). Rambam mentions this in passing in <a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/rambam.aspx?rid=3925\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">1:11</a>, in a case where there <em>are</em> lashes for a different prohibition (such as incest), and in such a case there is no fine (though he still must pay damages).</p>\n\n<p>As to <em>why</em> he isn't lashed for this offense, I think that it's more usual to not be punished with lashes in commandments between people (rather than between people and God). Most cases (such as theft, damages, extortion) demand repayment rather than lashes. Only a few cases (murder, manslaughter) carry a heavier penalty (death and exile respectively). It does seem that the case of rape was associated more with the former case than with the latter.</p>\n\n<p>(Note: I originally wrote that the reason was because the prohibition was attached to the positive commandment of marrying the woman. I changed it after some problems were pointed out with the answer.)</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# What is the relation of the Savoraim, Geonim, and Masoretes?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>I was taught that in the era immediately after the redaction of the Talmud, the Masoretes made what is now the final determination of which writings constituted the Tanach (for example, the book of Job is sacred writing, while the book of Judith is apocrypha).  I was also taught that the Masoraim determined the final \"layout\" of the Torah, that is, which words would have a break to the next line in the column, where there would be long or short gaps, what trup symbols were assigned to each word, and so forth. After that was the era of the Gaonim, and the great Rishonim (especially Rashi) leaned heavily on the work of the Gaonim (as well, of course, as the Talmud and the Midrach Rabbah).</p>\n<p>Now I have heard of the Savorim, which came right after the Talmud was redacted and in fact some Savorim are mentioned in the Talmud.  On Wikipedia, it is stated that the Gaonim came right after the Savorim.</p>\n<p>In that case, where do the Masoretes (Masorim?) come in? And where does that name come from?</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>EDIT</strong></p>\n<p>In response to a comment, I realized I misspoke--the Masoretes codified the standard <em>format</em> (wordings etc.) of the Torah scroll and Tanach, but the selection of which writings constitute the Tanach was made at a much earlier time, probably before the Gemarah started to be developed.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>To quote <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Masoretes\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Wikipedia</a></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The Masoretes (Hebrew: בעלי המסורה‎ Ba'alei ha-Masora) were groups of Jewish scribe-scholars who worked between the 6th and 10th centuries CE, based primarily in present-day Israel in the cities of Tiberias and Jerusalem, as well as in Iraq (Babylonia). Each group compiled a system of pronunciation and grammatical guides in the form of diacritical notes on the external form of the biblical text in an attempt to standardize the pronunciation, paragraph and verse divisions and cantillation of the Jewish Bible, the Tanakh, for the worldwide Jewish community.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>As noted there, they also determined the proper texts of these works.</p>\n\n<p>According to <a href=\"http://lib.cet.ac.il/pages/item.asp?item=8900\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">this</a>, the term massoretes either is related to the word 'massoret' (meaning tradition) referring to their transmission of traditions, or it is related to the word 'sephira' meaning counting. This would reference the massoretes' counting the number of words and letters and verses in different parts of scripture.</p>\n\n<p>They did not canonize Tanakh; this process happened earlier, by Hazal or even earlier.[i]</p>\n\n<p>It is important to emphasise that the Massoretes engaged in very specific studies; massoretic studies. This is distinct from the main topics of the Talmud, and the halakhic tradition spanning the Talmud, Savoraim, Geonim, and Rishonim.</p>\n\n<p>It is also worth noting, that even after the heyday of the Massoretes in the late Geonic period, later scholars continued to engage in massoretic activities, such as <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meir_Abulafia\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">R.

On his way to be killed a roman woman remarked that unfortunately he was being killed for defending the Jews but he would not get the same reward in the world to come since he was not circumcised.

Tosafos answer that he too was circumcised (נימול).<br>\nTosafos go on to quote this from the Yerushalmi in the first chapter of Megilla (halacha 13). There we find the statement that Antoninus was circumcised and ends off saying 'this is the statement that Antoninus converted'. </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>א''ל אנטונינוס לרבי את מאכילני מן לויתן לעתיד לבא\n  Antoninus said to Rabi will you give me to eat from the leviathan in the future?\n  א''ל אין \n  He (Rabi) responded yes.\n  א''ל מן אימר פסחא לית את מאכילני ומן לויתן את מאכילני \n  He (Antoninus) asked from a paschal sacrifice you will not feed me, but from the leviathon you will?\n  א''ל מה אעביד לך דהא כתיב וכל ערל לא יאכל בו \n  He (Rabi) said what can I do for you?

    "content": "# Mishkav/Mishkave... , Is there a difference?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>I am new to \"Mi Yodeya?\" and this is my first time asking questions.</p>\n\n<p>First, I have always heard that everything that is written in the Torah has a purposeful meaning; nothing in it is a coincidence or a mistake - has veshalom! My question is, then, why is it written \"mishkav zakhar\" - 'mishkav' (singular) - and \"mishkeve isha\" - from 'mishkavim' (plural)? Do males have just one \"mishkav\" and females more than one?  Lastly, what is the meaning of 'mishkav/mishkavim'? I know that individually they mean 'lying/s (as on a bed), and bed/bedding.</p>\n\n<p>I want to understand the phraseology of 'mishkav zakhar'. The only place I remember seeing it is in Numbers 31:17-18. I want to understand it so that I may better understand Lev. 18:22 and 20:13. Numbers 31:17-18 says: \" ועתה הרגו כל זכר בטף, וכל אשה ידעת איש למשכב זכר הרגו. וכל הטף בנשים אשר לא ידעו משכב זכר החיו לכם.\"</p>\n\n<p>Thanks.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 5)\n\n<p>The phrase means literally \"the lying of a man\" and is euphemistic for intimate relations as performed by a man, which is how it is generally <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Numbers.30-31?lang=bi\" rel=\"noreferrer\">translated</a> in the verses (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Numbers.30-31?lang=bi\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Numbers 31:17-18</a>) you cite:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>וְעַתָּ֕ה הִרְג֥וּ כָל־זָכָ֖ר בַּטָּ֑ף וְכָל־אִשָּׁ֗ה יֹדַ֥עַת אִ֛ישׁ לְמִשְׁכַּ֥ב זָכָ֖ר הֲרֹֽגוּ׃</p>\n<p>Now, therefore, slay every male among the children, and slay also every woman who has known a man carnally;</p>\n<p>וְכֹל֙ הַטַּ֣ף בַּנָּשִׁ֔ים אֲשֶׁ֥ר לֹא־יָדְע֖וּ מִשְׁכַּ֣ב זָכָ֑ר הַחֲי֖וּ לָכֶֽם׃</p>\n<p>but spare every young woman who has not had carnal relations with a man.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The converse phrase משכבי אשה is used to denote the ways one might lie with a woman (literally: the lyings of a woman) as in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Leviticus.18.22?lang=bi\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Leviticus 18:22</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>וְאֶ֨ת־זָכָ֔ר לֹ֥א תִשְׁכַּ֖ב מִשְׁכְּבֵ֣י אִשָּׁ֑ה תּוֹעֵבָ֖ה הִֽוא׃</p>\n<p>Do not lie with a male as one lies with a woman; it is an abhorrence.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>and <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Leviticus.20.13?lang=bi\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Leviticus 20:13</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>וְאִ֗ישׁ אֲשֶׁ֨ר יִשְׁכַּ֤ב אֶת־זָכָר֙ מִשְׁכְּבֵ֣י אִשָּׁ֔ה תּוֹעֵבָ֥ה עָשׂ֖וּ שְׁנֵיהֶ֑ם מ֥וֹת יוּמָ֖תוּ דְּמֵיהֶ֥ם בָּֽם׃</p>\n<p>If a man lies with a male as one lies with a woman, the two of them have done an abhorrent thing; they shall be put to death—their blood is upon them.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The Talmud (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Sanhedrin.54a.29?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Sanhedrin 54a</a>) notes, as did you, the usage of the plural with regard to the lying of the woman and derives accordingly that there are two (anatomical) ways to lay with a woman:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>משכבי אשה מגיד לך הכתוב ששני משכבות באשה</p>\n<p>“the lyings of a woman” - The verse teaches you that there are two (anatomical) manners of lying with a woman.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>Simple answer is yes there is a very good reason, though sorry, it's somewhat graphic.</p>\n\n<p>\"Mishkevei isha\" (plural) refers to vaginal and anal; only one of those applies to males.

However, from reading various articles, it appears to have been in common usage for many decades. <a href=\"https://www.wisetemple.org/study/rabbis-blog/tizku-lmitzvahpay-it-foward/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">This article</a> seems to support the notion that at least the concept supporting the expression is from <a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=53085&st=&pgnum=50\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Pirkei Avot 4:2</a> where Ben Azai says that one should be careful to perform every \"type\" of mitzvah - both \"easy\" and \"difficult\" ones, because one mitzvah \"pulls\" (or instigates) another mitzvah, and the reward of a mitzvah is (another) mitzvah.</p>\n\n<p>Rav Bartenura, in his commentary, explains the concept of the \"reward\" part, in that when one performs a mitzvah, in heaven, another mitzvah is prepared for that person so that the person may receive reward for both of them.</p>\n\n<p>So, I gather that the idea behind the wish \"tizkeh lemitzvot\" is in line with Rav Bartenura's explanation. When you give tzedaka (though, the wish is not limited to hearing this from tzedaka recipients), the person is using the plural form \"mitzvoth\" as a hint that you should merit to be able to perform another mitzvah and receive the reward for both the tzedaka giving as well as the next mitzvah.</p>\n\n\n",

You can assume that this person has zero personal Jewish background (read: isn’t Jewish) but knows the basics about Judaism's beliefs and fundamentals.<sup>2</sup></p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p><sup>1</sup>Paraphrase of Kiddushin 30b</p>\n\n<p><sup>2</sup>Similar questions such as <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/search?q=title%3A%22how%22+title%3A%22explain%22+is%3Aquestion\">these</a> have been asked before, so this shouldn't be off-topic (at least not for that reason).</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 16)\n\n<p>(1) Compare it to an intellectual pursuit they already know. And (2), show don't tell.</p>\n\n<p>I've never had the benefit of full-time learning in yeshiva, but I've participated in some shorter programs that were also more beginner-friendly but no less engaging.  Here's (approximately) how I explained the attraction to some non-Jewish friends who are geeks about something else (science fiction in this case, but many people are geeky about <em>something</em>):</p>\n\n<p>\"You know how you and Bob sometimes spend hours talking about how time travel works, many-worlds theory, butterfly effects, and the practicalities of going to the future and returning?  And sometimes you disagree about how paradoxes would be resolved?  You obviously get a lot of pleasure from those discussions, even though you can't directly use the answers.  Well, talmud study provides the same kind of stimulation for me, exploring all the different ways to interpret something and what the implications of those interpretations would be, and even in the cases when I can't directly use the knowledge I still enjoy it.  And then, on top of that, I get the joy that comes from knowing that I'm fulfilling an actual <em>religious command</em> by doing this.  Pretty neat, huh?\"</p>\n\n<p>I once enthused at some length to some friends about a visit I'd just had to a <em>beit midrash</em> where I joined a <em>chevruta</em> of two rabbinic students.  They were working from <em>shas</em>, no English translation, but because I was a visitor they gave me a pointed text.  Then they proceeded to treat me -- someone way below their level of knowledge -- as an equal, including taking my turns at translating (not always correctly and with Jastrow at hand).  The idea that while we all have different levels of knowledge, we all have <em>seats at the table</em> and are encouraged to <em>try</em> really made an impression on me, and my excitedly talking about it made an impression on my friends.</p>\n\n<p>Let them see your joy, and even if they don't understand the details, they'll still get the general idea.  If you can relate it to something they're really into, that helps.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>This is a great question, because I have been asked this from multiple people - Jews and non-Jews. My answer, of course, is different to each of them, but I'll mention the commonalities.</p>\n\n<p>First of all, before answering, I think you really need to analyze well the intention of the questioner, as you would with any question. Only if the questioner is really willing to hear your opinion as is, even if he disagrees with your answer, in whole or part, should you attempt to answer. Someone who is hostile or is trying to test or trick you should outrightly be ignored, in terms of your answering.</p>\n\n<p>Assuming a positive reception, I think your answer can be quite simple. The essential style of the Talmud is the Socratic learning method. Many people, today, don't learn this way, but it has proven to be a very effective learning method. (I'll see if I can include a link to an article about this, for your interest.) The idea behind the Socratic method is that someone makes a statement, questions are asked and proofs to support or refute that statement are made. Another answer is usually given, and this cycle repeats.</p>\n\n<p>The joy of experiencing this learning method is demonstrated by the fact that almost everyone's opinion is valued. And, a statement is rarely taken and accepted at face value. People can question it, analyze it, argue with it, etc. </p>\n\n<p>In current U.S. society, and much of the world, even though the media has a huge influence on forcing people to think a certain way, in reality, when you speak to the average person, they really treasure their own way of thinking, and like to debate an idea. If you want to go further, you can explain that the Talmud does not really subscribe to \"political correctness\", and, in a sense, that's probably the greatest pleasure. Not only does the Talmud, itself, encourage debate within its own pages, but, the study of their debate can be debated among the very people who study it. </p>\n\n<p>In terms of answering the question, how can people yell at each other yet still walk away friends - that's exactly the very joy that the Talmud, itself, encourages. What's sad about today's society, esp. in business and offices is that knowledge is \"compartmentalized\". The way people get ahead is by keeping knowledge to themselves and not sharing it with others. G-d forbid, if someone should know more than you, they will outmaneuver you and you might lose your job. (Whether this is true in a specific job, is not my point, here. Often, this is more a fear than reality.) The Talmud, has no such notions of such \"knowledge competition\". When two friends sit together learning together and debating a page of Talmud, they are sharing knowledge. This, in itself, is one of the most visible demonstrations of unselfishness and friendship that I can think of! Each person is willing to share his knowledge with the other with the full intention of making the other more knowledgeable. </p>\n\n<p>I will admit, though, that one can certainly debate the concept of students studying Talmud the entire or the majority of the day vs. learning a career skill or working at it, esp. if the struggle to support their family. That's a separate discussion, as well as a valid question Gentiles and Jews may ask and discuss. There's no single answer for this.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>Not a complete description, but has some truth to it.</p>\n\n<p>From Leon Paliakov:</p>\n\n<p>A goy insisted that a Talmudist explain to him what the Talmud was.

Which of the two will wash himself?’</p>\n\n<p>“‘The one who is dirty,’ answered the goy. ‘No, for the one who’s dirty sees the others’ clean face and believes he is clean too. The one who’s clean sees a dirty face and believes his is dirty too.’ ‘I understand!’ the goy exclaimed. ‘I’m beginning to understand what the Talmud is.’</p>\n\n<p>“‘No, you have understood nothing at all, the rabbi interrupted, for how could two men have come down the same chimney, one dirty and the other clean?’”</p>\n\n\n",

He's not a safrut expert, and, neither of us had ever seen anything like this. He surmised that the word immediately before and immediately after the correction (the full correction is in much smaller script than the surrounding text.) is <em>Elohim</em> which is one of G-d's names. The rav explained that one is not allowed to erase G-d's name unless there really is an error in the Torah in that name. So, the <em>sofer</em> was limited to correcting things in that limited space, but it still seems that he ran out of space when arriving at the last word.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/uCtaU.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/uCtaU.jpg\" alt=\"picture of torah scroll\"></a></p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 8)\n\n<p>Shulchan Arukh <a href=\"https://he.wikisource.org/wiki/%D7%A9%D7%95%D7%9C%D7%97%D7%9F_%D7%A2%D7%A8%D7%95%D7%9A_%D7%99%D7%95%D7%A8%D7%94_%D7%93%D7%A2%D7%94_%D7%A8%D7%A2%D7%95\" rel=\"noreferrer\">YD 276:1</a></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>טעה ודילג תיבה או יותר -- יכול לתלותה בין השיטין אבל לא בריוח שבין דף לדף:‏<br>\n  [If a scribe] erred and skipped a word or more -- he can hang it between the lines but not in the space between the columns.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Seems like you guys basically figured this one out. It looks like the scribe accidentally skipped a line, and since he couldn't erase God's name, he had to squeeze two lines worth of text into one line. He ran out of room and hung the last word between the lines. Obviously not an ideal situation, but still kosher (in theory, though I'm not making any rulings on that particular scroll based just on half a picture; indeed when hanging a missing word one is generally supposed to start it just above the beginning of the next word, not centered over the gap between words as in your picture).</p>\n\n<p>Remember even when hanging words between the lines the letters still need to be formed properly. Also there are various restrictions regarding the amount one can hang between the lines and regarding writing God's name in this fashion.</p>\n\n\n",

The only definition I can find is that its nat bar nat.  But no mention is made of ben yomo or not.  Does DE imply ben yomo or non ben yomo?</p></li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Thanks,</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>The Shulchan Aruch addresses all of this. The point is that some taste particles may have wound up in the walls of the pot. As shishim is measured by volume, not mass, and volumes aren't necessarily additive (1 gallon water + 1 gallon alcohol = 1.96 gallons total), we can only play it safe if we assume there was a volume of milk/meat/non-kosher taste particles in the pot walls equivalent to the total volume of the metal of the pot. It is thus very rare to have 60 against such a volume.</p>\n\n<p>(The one exception would be if I take a brand-new pot, pour in 1 cup of beef broth, and boil; then I pour it out and clean out the pot. Now I pour 62 cups of milk into the pot and boil. In this case, I know that there is no more than 1 cup total of meaty particles contained in the walls of this pot, so it is in fact batel. [Bonus points for discussion of other opinions on <em>chan\"an</em> in this case.] But generally, pots have been used a lot, so we assume the volume of the walls to be entirely filled with flavor particles.)</p>\n\n<p>This is why we have to resort to <em>nat bar nat</em> when cooking pareve soup in a dairy pot (for Sephardim anyway), as <em>bitul beshishim</em> is unlikely. </p>\n\n<p>To answer your second question: In industrial applications we generally assume <em>ben yomo</em>; a company could easily do a dairy run and a non-dairy run in the same day. (If anything, they're very unlikely to let their machinery sit unused for a whole 24 hours!) So the \"DE\" potato soup is the industrial equivalent of if you boiled milk in a pot, washed it out, then an hour later boiled <em>pareve</em> potato soup -- the general guidance from kashrus agencies is <em>you don't have to wait six hours, but don't eat it with meat!</em>; this is exactly how the Ramah and Shach come out in this case.</p>\n\n<p>(A true case of <em>nat bar nat</em> means the food is completely pareve; i.e. you can mix it with meat or milk.) </p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<ol>\n<li><p>We do nullify a pot, but we cannot intentionally nullify only if it happens by accident ש׳׳ע יורה דעה צט, סע׳ ה.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Yes ben yomo or not can have ramifications. For instance if it is not ben yomo this might make the amount not required to be 60x. See ש׳׳ע יורה דעה צט, סע׳ ז. Where there a vessel that is only used with abundant food like a vat, may nullify intentionally however says the Beir Heitiv and Taz, that this requires for a 24 hour wait period (eino ben yomo) to be done intentionally.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Yes</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>It doesn't imply anything about ben yomo, therefore one must consider it possibly ben yomo.

The Talmud itself made the suggestion of using a Torah as a <em>get</em>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>ההוא גברא דעל לבי כנישתא שקל ספר תורה יהיב לה לדביתהו ואמר לה הא גיטך אמר רב יוסף למאי ליחוש לה אי משום מי מילין אין מי מילין על גבי מי מילין אי אי משום כריתות דאית בה הא בעינא וכתב לה לשמה וליכא וכי תימא ליחוש דילמא אקדים ויהב ליה זוזא לספרא מעיקרא הא בעינן שינה שמו ושמה שם עירו ושם עירה וליכא</p>\n  \n  <p>A certain man went to the synagogue and took a scroll of the Law and gave it to his wife saying. 'Here is thy Get'. Said R. Joseph: Why should we take any notice of it? Shall we say that the Get was written in gall-nut water [on the outside of the scroll]? Gall-nut water does not make any mark on [a sheet treated with] gall-nut water. Shall we say that the scroll is itself a Get because of the portion it contains relating to 'cutting off'? We require that it should be written for that woman specifically, which is not here the case. If you should plead that possibly he gave, beforehand, a fee to the scribe [to write the passage in the scroll specifically for her], this also is unavailing, since we require [the insertion of] his name and her name, the name of his town and the name of her town, which we do not [find here].

That it contains severance? But we need \"and he writes\"! We see [from here] that if not for \"and he writes\" which requires it to be [written] for her, on account of the language of severance alone — which is a language of dismissal — without any other clarification we could say that she is divorced.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Thus, the mere presence of the word כריתות in the Torah (וכתב לה ספר כריתות) apparently suffices.</p>\n\n<p>Putting this aside, your question is actually explicitly asked by <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moshe_Mordechai_Epstein\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">R.

A <em>get</em> needs to be written with the text of a <em>get</em>! Where is the text of a <em>get</em> written in a Torah scroll?</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>And he answers:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>והנה אם נימא דמועיל במכירה או במתנה שימסור לו שטר שכתוב בו שדי מכורה או נתונה בלי הזכרת שם המוכר והלוקח היה אפשר לומר דגם בגט אם יכתוב על נייר הרי את מותרת לכל אדם וימסור לה בפני עדי מסירה יהיה גט וכן אם יכתוב תיבות אלו ספר כריתות וימסור לה בעדי מסירה יהיה די ועל זה קאמר בגמ' גבי מי שגירש את אשתו בס\"ת דלמא אקדים ויהיב זוזי לספרא שיכתוב התיבות ספר כריתות לשמו ולשמה ומשום זה יהיה גט וכן כתב רש\"י כריתות דאית בה שכתובה בה פרשת וכתב לה ספר כריתות עכ\"ל וע\"ז קאמר הא בעינן שמו ושמה פירוש הא דכתיב וכתב לה ספר כריתות דילפינן דבעינן שיחשוב לשמו ולשמה היינו דאמרינן דגם מחשבה צריכין אבל ודאי צריך שיהיה כתוב בפירוש מה שצריכין לחשוב ופירוש הכתוב וכתב לה ספר כריתות שיהיה כתוב בהגט שהוא כתב לה ספר כריתות ורק דמחשבת לשמה גם כן בעינן וכן כתב הר\"ן בקידושין דבגט דכתיב ספר כריתות בעינן שיהא כתוב בגט ספירת הדברים שהגט כורת בינו לבינה היינו שם האיש והאשה בפירוש</p>\n  \n  <p>Now, if we say that by a sale or a gift it works for him to give him a document that says \"my field is sold\" or \"[my field] is given\" without mentioning the name of the seller or the buyer, then we can perhaps say that by a <em>get</em> as well if he writes on a paper \"you are hereby permitted to any man\" and he gives it to her in the presence of delivery witnesses then it would be a <em>get</em>. And so too if he writes the words \"document of severance\" and gives it to her with delivery witnesses, it would suffice. And about this the Talmud said in the case of one who divorced his wife with a Torah scroll, \"perhaps he preceded and gave the scribe money\" to write the words \"document of severance\" for his sake and for her sake and thus it would be a <em>get</em>. And so wrote Rashi: \"the severance that is in it — that the section of 'he writes for her a document of severance' is in it,\" end quote. And to this [the Talmud] said \"but it needs his name and her name!\" Meaning, that which is written [in the Torah] \"and he writes a document of severance for her\" from which we learn that he needs to intend it for his sake and for her sake, that is that we say that intent is <em>also</em> necessary, but certainly that which must be intended must be explicitly written. And the meaning of the verse \"and he writes a document of severance for her\" is that it should be written in the <em>get</em> that he is writing her a document of severance, but that it also requires intent for her sake. And so wrote the Ran in Kiddushin, that by a <em>get</em> where it is written [in the Torah] \"a document of severance\" the <em>get</em> must have written in it a narration that the <em>get</em> severs [the bond] between him and her, specifically, the name of the man and the woman explicitly.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Online videos of shiurim\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>Are non-Jews allowed to watch online videos of shiurim, and if so, how would a Gentile know if he or she is permitted to watch it? </p>\n\n<p>As a non-Jew, I like spending time watching YouTube videos of rabbis (i.e. Rabbi Yosef Mizrachi, Rabbi Tovia Singer, Rabbi Alon Anava) giving lectures on various Torah subjects as I find them to be spiritually enlightening. Since these videos are posted online and accessible to the public, I have to assume that anyone is permitted to watch them. My concern (perhaps I'm overly concerned) however is that there may be some material that non-Jews are forbidden to watch/listen to even though it's accessible online. If so, how can I determine if that's the case?  </p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>Thank you or your concern and the sensitive way you bring your question to this forum. There is no law preventing anyone from watching Jewish lectures.</p>\n\n<p>There are seven laws relevant for non-Jews, called the seven Noahide laws (as they were given to Noah, the father of all of humanity). In one explanation (see <a href=\"http://www.chabad.org/therebbe/article_cdo/aid/62221/jewish/Universal-Morality.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a>)</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>[the first of the seven laws is] to acknowledge there is only one God who is\n  Infinite and Supreme above all things. [...] This command includes\n  such acts as prayer, study and meditation.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>As such, if you watch online lectures to further your understanding of God and his commandments as they apply to you, you are actually fulfilling God's laws for non-Jews (see <a href=\"http://www.aish.com/w/nj/For_Non-Jews.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a> for more on the seven laws).</p>\n\n<p>It is true that the Talmud writes that a gentile is not permitted to study Torah and Jews from teaching it to them. Related to your case, one of last generation's leading sages, Rabbi Moshe Feinstein rules that one is permitted to teach Torah to Jews while a non-Jew is listening (Igros Moshe, Yoreh Deah 2:132) (taken from <a href=\"http://www.yeshiva.co/midrash/shiur.asp?id=14572\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a>). And all agree that one is permitted to teach non-Jews about their obligations. See <a href=\"http://www.jpost.com/Magazine/Judaism/Ask-the-rabbi-May-a-Jew-teach-Torah-to-a-gentile\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a> and <a href=\"http://www.yeshiva.co/midrash/shiur.asp?id=14572\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a> if you wish to learn more.</p>\n\n<p>See also <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/23042/non-jews-learning-or-being-taught-torah\">here</a> for a related question on MY.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>From my understanding a non-Jew intending to convert is allowed to learn Gemara.</p>\n\n<p>As for not intending to convert but listening for the sake of spiritual enlightenment, the Torah does say something like \"Israel will be a light to the nations\", and it says that in the messianic era, knowledge of God will be plentiful and everyone will know it, and it also says that 10 non-Jews will chase after one Jew wanting to learn the truth.</p>\n\n<p>But if someone wants to learn Torah in order to cast doubt anyway they can (like heretics and atheists) then I don't think that is allowed.</p>\n\n\n",

But either way, it doesn’t come from the heart. So where do all of these descriptions come from?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>You are asking the question based on the modern metaphors and using scientific terminology. This does not apply to the metaphors that the Torah uses. The Torah uses the heart as the seat of the will and desires of a person (יצר טוב and יצר הרע) As a result, it expresses matters in that way.</p>\n\n<p>This is not a matter of modern science. This is what the Torah metaphors are used for. The brain would be pure logic, the heart the will and desires, the liver and kidneys the emotions. All of these are nowadays referred to the brain, but in tanach and the talmud that is what the metaphors are used for. </p>\n\n<p>The heart is not the seat of the emotions, that is the modern English usage. In the Tanach, it is the seat of the will and personality not the emotions.</p>\n\n<p>This is explained in <a href=\"http://www.houseofdavid.ca/body_metaphors_bib_hebrew.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Some Body Part Metaphors and Euphemisms in Biblical Hebrew</a></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <ul>\n  <li>The total personality of a person.

This mean both the yetzer tov and the yetzer harah in a person must be influenced and controlled by the command of Hashem. Thus, the לב is the seat of the yetzer of a person, the will and desires.</p>\n\n<p>Similarly, the <a href=\"http://www.chabad.org/library/bible_cdo/aid/9943#v=39&showrashi=true\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Torah commands</a></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>This shall be fringes for you, and when you see it, you will remember\n  all the commandments of the Lord to perform them, and you shall not\n  wander after your hearts and after your eyes after which you are going\n  astray.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><strong>Rashi</strong></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><strong>and you shall not wander after your hearts:</strong> Heb. וְלֹא תָתוּרוּ, like “from scouting (מִּתּוּר) the Land” (13:25). The heart and eyes\n  are the spies for the body. They are its agents for sinning: the eye\n  sees, the heart covets and the body commits the transgression. - [Mid.\n  Tanchuma 15]</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p><strong>The Torah speaks about a psychological concept of a heart, not the physiological organ.</strong> </p>\n\n<p><sub>Psychology works by making up concepts and describing interactions between them.

This approach is consistent with Rambam (beg. of Yesodey Hatora) explaining the reference to G-ds bodyparts in the Torah, like יד ה', רגלי ה', עיני ה' etc. Once again, the concept existed long before anatomy.</p></li>\n</ol>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>NB: <em>I agree that we don't know the correlation between this concept of Tifferet and the physical heart that pumps the blood.

I know of several such cases firsthand.</p>\n\n<p>Note that as Judaism does not acknowledge any binding tie of marriage between a Jew and a non-Jew, if the first husband wasn't Jewish, this would not be necessary.</p>\n\n<p>If any of this may be practical for you or anyone you know, please contact the experts: info@bethDin.org. They are based in New York, but can make connections or references all over the world. Or if you're in Europe, try the London Beth Din. <a href=\"https://www.theus.org.uk/article/divorce-0\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Here's a good article from them about the process</a>; their phone number is listed as +44 020 8343 6270.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>Second question: does a civil marriage still require a Jewish divorce ritual to dissolve? </p>\n\n<p>The short answer is that this was subject to a lot of debate in the twentieth century. (It may even depend on how seriously people took civil marriage; in the Soviet Union, it was argued, people got them and dissolved them all the time, they just needed the bigger apartment! An even weaker case came up in the US if the civil marriage was a sham for the sake of someone's immigrant visa.) Everyone agrees that when at all possible, she should contact the ex and go through a Jewish divorce ritual. (If he's no longer alive, or he wasn't Jewish, then it's not a problem.) There are responsa of Rabbi Moshe Feinstein (who allowed it if necessary), his senior peer Rabbi Joseph Elijah Henkin (who didn't), and many others on this subject.</p>\n\n<p>Similarly, here's the <a href=\"https://www.theus.org.uk/article/divorce-0\" rel=\"noreferrer\">London Beth Din's policy</a> (emphasis added):</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Since Jewish law regards the mere fact of setting up home and living together as being possible evidence of marriage, <strong>the question should be asked of the Beth Din whether a Get is required in the event of ... registry office marriages</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

Why not just live with, and have relations with, whomever you like?  No marriage means no difficulties in ending it.</p>\n\n<p>If you're hesitating at that -- if you think that the concept of \"marriage\" has some meaning and you're just questioning which type (civil or religious) -- then the first part of the answer is: because a civil \"marriage\" isn't a marriage according to Judaism at all.</p>\n\n<p>Here are some reasons for couples to want a Jewish marriage:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>Because the torah elevates it.  A man leaves his mother and father and clings to his wife, not his \"friend with privileges\".</p></li>\n<li><p>Marriage is a long-term commitment.  I know it doesn't always work out that way, and the rabbis say (Gittin 90a-b, h/t  DonielF) that when a (Jewish) marriage ends the altar weeps.  In other words, it's a big deal.</p></li>\n<li><p>Marital status affects the status of children.  Even people who don't care about properly forming a marriage for <em>themselves</em> often care about it for their kids.</p></li>\n<li><p>Because this is how we do things.  Even secular Jews have Jewish weddings -- because it's what their family, community, or people does.  You probably have some things that you do because it's what your family does; now expand that to all of <em>klal yisrael</em> and consider how much stronger that pull might be.</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Yes, there is risk in marriage.  <em>Halacha</em> offers some ways to mitigate this risk, but it's still a risk.  But to someone who is religious, a civil marriage isn't a marriage at all, so what choice do you have?  If you want to be Jewishly married you have to accept this risk.</p>\n\n<p>I wish that we could solve the <em>agunah</em> problem.  It's painful.  It destroys lives.  It's a real problem, and I am not trying to dismiss it.  But I'm saying that we don't have an alternative.  Childbirth is painful and sometimes destroys lives too, but people have children anyway.  If you decide something is important enough, you take the risk.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 8)\n\n<p>Assuming that marrying through a civil ceremony would prevent future possible agunah scenarios (which isn't really true, <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/a/85486/5346\">@Shalom's excellent answer</a> to your other question), there are still plenty of reasons to marry properly according to Halacha:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p>Not marrying properly means that the entire time the couple are together they are committing sins. The large majority of marriages do not result in an Agunah scenario, so for the overwhelming majority of scenarios, there will just be couples living in sin with no potential \"gain\" for doing so.</p></li>\n<li><p>Agunahs, while a horrible situation for those trapped, is not too common. We wouldn't change important constructs without a good reason. Everything in life has risks, but we weigh the risks to benefits to decide whether to do it. There is a risk every time one gets into a car, but if you have to drive to work, that's what you do.</p></li>\n<li><p>It's a psychological thing as well. You're about to commit to spend the rest of your life with someone. It's got to be a bit weird to do so in a way that leaves a 'loophole' in case the marriage doesn't work out as hoped (and yes, I'm aware that's what a prenup, and in some sense, a Kesubah is, but I would still feel weird suggesting that, until it becomes standard practice for every couple to do so).</p></li>\n</ol>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 5)\n\n<p>I’d like to take this a step further than the other excellent answers. Those all address <em>that</em> we have Kiddushin u’Nisuin.<sup>1</sup> I’d like to address <em>why</em>. </p>\n\n<p>It is, in fact, is a debate between the Rosh (Rav Asher ben Yechiel, 1250/59-1327) and the Rambam (Rav Moshe ben Maimon), whether it’s a mitzvah to get married at all. The Rosh (Kesuvos 1:12) writes that we must get married as a part of the mitzvah to have children. The Rambam (Ishus 1) writes that marriage is actually a mitzvah on its own from the Torah, and there is a further prohibition for having intimacy with a woman who you have not taken as your wife via Kiddushin, which takes effect on each and every act of intimacy.<sup>2</sup></p>\n\n<p>But whether Kiddushin is a mitzvah or part of a different one, it still begs the original question of <em>why</em>. </p>\n\n<p>The Sefer HaChinuch (552) writes several reasons for Kiddushin:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>There should be something to formalize the marriage, that the man not come upon her as he would a harlot, with no prior interaction. </li>\n<li>A woman who goes through this process will be permanently aware that she is married and therefore will not come to commit adultery or rebel, but will rather respect and honor her husband, as a servant to his master. Thus their life will be peaceful, and society will be established with the Will of HaShem.<sup>3</sup>\n\n<ul>\n<li>This is why the custom is to use a ring, something which is always present and a constant reminder, even though technically a tiny perutah may be used. </li>\n</ul></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>To answer your question fully, however, we must address two other obligations: not to be intimate without marriage, and to divorce with a get. </p>\n\n<p>In respect to the former, the Chinuch (570), quoting the Rambam (Sefer HaMitzvos, Lo Sa’aseh 355) writes that if the Torah just set forth the laws of rape and seduction, one may have thought that being intimate with one outside the framework of marriage was just a monetary matter; after all, all a rapist has to do is pay the father 50 shekalim and take care of the girl, and he gets to be her husband. If it’s a monetary matter, well, it’s is up to the two parties to do whatever they want with their money. What the prohibition of pre-marital intimacy is coming to add is that it’s not just a monetary matter, but a moral and spiritual one as well; thus, the passuk states (Vayikra 19:29) that one should not “desecrate” his daughter to make her a harlot, lest the land become “lewd” and the land become “full of immorality.” </p>\n\n<p>As for divorce, the Sefer HaChinuch writes (579) that since in an ideal marriage the husband and wife should work harmoniously, there must be an out if this doesn’t work. What is the alternative, that they remain married forever? Then when the wife and husband hate each other, she will go ahead and burn his property to the ground, commit adultery before his eyes - and there’s nothing he can do about it! </p>\n\n<p>Why, then, must it be done with a document? Maybe he can just tell her to leave, and that will be enough. If that were the case, though, a woman could just commit adultery and claim that her husband sent her away before she committed the act, and she would be able to get away with it! (Remember that witnesses are never required on documents on a Torah level.) Further, if the husband is upset with his wife and can yell at her to divorce her, she would be divorced immediately; if he must go through the trouble of writing a document, he will have a chance to let his anger subside and to reconcile with his wife. </p>\n\n<p>In summary, then, the purpose of these laws is to indicate that marriage is more than just a monetary contract for the wife’s “services”; it’s a holy bond between man and wife. It cannot simply be broken by word, as that would result in the very situations we are trying to prevent (i.e. immorality). Yes, every now and then this will result in the terrible situation of an agunah, and we do all we can to try to prevent such a situation (see Gittin 2a-3a, regarding bringing a get from overseas - for certain things, “because of an agunah the Rabbis were lenient”). Sometimes it’s not enough. But usually it is enough, and that’s a risk we’re willing to take, for the greater good.  </p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p><sup>1</sup> I guess this is as good a time as any to point out that Jewish marriage has two stages - Kiddushin/Eirusin (the ring, though it could be several other things - see Mishnah, Kiddushin 2a) and Nisuin (referred to here as Chuppah, the white canopy - though I’m aware it’s debated when the Nisuin actually takes place nowadays). Although in practice we do these two actions together (or at least the same night), there used to be a 12-month gap in between them. </p>\n\n<p><sup>2</sup>For further discussion of these opinions, see Teshuvos HaRivash 395, and Ran, Kiddushin 16a s.v. איכא דאמרי. </p>\n\n<p><sup>3</sup> These aren’t my words - go blame the Chinuch for being politically incorrect.</p>\n\n\n",

We still have this meaning in words like happen, happening, happenstance.</p>\n<p>Over time \"happy\" came to mean only good luck, not bad. \"Luck\" and \"fortune\" had the same evolution - you can have bad luck or misfortune, but lucky and fortunate mean only good things. So happy came to mean \"fortunate.\"</p>\n<p>It took many centuries for \"happy\" to change from meaning \"fortunate\" to meaning a person's positive internal emotional state, often but not always caused by external fortunate events.</p>\n<p>Nowadays the \"fortunate\" meaning of \"happy\" is mostly obsolete, and \"happy\" refers mostly to the emotional state - the opposite of sad, but less emphatic than joyful.</p>\n<p>For several hundred years, though, both meanings of \"happy\" existed side by side.  The Oxford English Dictionary gives the very earliest \"emotional state\" meaning use as being in 1525, while the \"fortunate\" meaning was still in use at the end of the 19th century.</p>\n<p>When you read translations of Biblical texts - such as the quote from Job (\"happy is the man whom God corrects\") and the the others in the comments above - keep in mind you are reading material that was either written a century or more ago, or modern material that is strongly influenced by prior translations. So the fact that a translation of Job uses \"happy\" doesn't necessarily imply that someone corrected by God is experiencing an emotionally pleasurable feeling.</p>\n<p>Even though there's still a bit of \"good fortune\" lingering around the word \"happy,\" that meaning is mostly gone from ordinary use. Yet it seems to me that the translations of \"ashrei\" as \"happy\" are more focussed on the \"fortunate\" meaning of the original texts. So I would vote for translating ashrei as \"fortunate\" over \"happy\" unless it's clear that a specific person's inner emotional feelings are intended.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>Rav Shimshon Rafael Hirsch translates ashrei as \"striding forward\", both in Tehillim and in Chumash.

I would like to know if there is any demarcation as to when these groups were formally viewed as separate, so for example Rabbinic bans enacted by one group would not apply to the other. By way of analogy there are individuals who are seen as the last of a certain era (Tanaaim, Geonim, Rishonim etc.) these people can be viewed as demarcating between one epoch and another even though there was a transition which may have taken years. Does such a thing exist in terms of the split between Ashkenaz and Sephard?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>Edit based on the discussion in the comments:\nAs the OP mentioned, this demarcation can't be accurately attributed to a specific time, because A. Differentiating between Ashkenazim and Sephardim oversimplifies the differences between communities in Europe, Africa and the middle East, and B. Even if we oversimplify in such a way, it was a process of probably hundreds of years until the split was complete (or as complete as it ever got).</p>\n<p>Even so, I tried answering the question in a way that shows that a majority of (what we now call) Ashkenazim paskened differently than a majority of (what we now call) Sephardim and other non- European communities, this showing that the demarcation had already begun to take effect.</p>\n<p>One early sign of this demarcation is the Cherem d'Rabbeinu Gershom on marrying two wives. Rabbinic Gershom Maor Hagolah was a Rosh Yeshiva in Germany during the late 10th and early 11th century, and his takkana was accepted by all of European (Ashkenazi) Jewry, but not by most Sefardi or other communities (see, for example, Yabia Omer part 8 Even Ha'ezer 2).</p>\n<p>Though it's not fully clear <em>when</em> all of the Ashkenazi communities accepted this takana, of note is the fact that (according to Wikipedia <a href=\"https://he.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D7%A8%D7%91%D7%A0%D7%95_%D7%92%D7%A8%D7%A9%D7%95%D7%9D\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://he.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D7%A8%D7%91%D7%A0%D7%95_%D7%92%D7%A8%D7%A9%D7%95%D7%9D</a>) most of the gedolim of the generation after rabbeinu Gershom were his students, and Rashi wrote about him:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>רבינו גרשום זכר צדיק וקדוש לברכה שמאיר עיני גולה וכולנו מפיו חיין וכל בני גלות אשכנז וכיתים תלמידי תלמידיו הן</p>\n<p>Rabbeinu Gershom zecher tzadik vekadosh l'bracha, who lights up the eyes of the exiled and from whose mouth we all live and <strong>all of the exiled of Ashkenaz and kittim (understood to mean Italy) are students of his students</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>In addition to Rashi quoting the takana outright in one of his t'shuvos (quoted by the Mordechai Bava Kama siman 210) which indicate that his psaks, and especially his Cherem, were probably well accepted almost immediately (Rashi was only a generation younger than rabbeinu Gershom) among the Ashkenazi communities.</p>\n<p>In the comments, a claim was made that maybe some Sephardim also accepted the takana at first, and then later changed their minhag to match other communities. While this could be true, it must have been on a small enough scale that it's rarely mentioned, and not paskened at all, among the Sephardi rishonim, which doesn't affect the claim that at this point in time there was a clear demarcation.</p>\n<p>This is the first relatively clear demarcation I could find between Ashkenazi Jews and others (Sephardi, Yemenite etc.), though it may have happened earlier.</p>\n\n\n",

[...] Accordingly, “Strength and gladness are in His place,” because He is but good all the time. <strong>Therefore, first of all, man ought to be happy and joyous at every time and hour, and truly live by his faith in G‑d, Who animates him and acts kindly towards him at every moment.

If this is only an ideal level one should strive towards - meaning that the overwhelming majority of people will not reach it - why is there such a harsh rebuke of those people being compared to heretics?</p></li>\n<li><p>What about the Torah sanctioned or even halachically mandated instances of when one should be sad and grieve/lament (for example mourning a relative, or lamenting the destruction of the Temple)? The reasoning (that all seemingly bad events and calamities only seem that way, but are actually good) would apply even to these instances. And, in fact, the quote above seems to require being happy and joyous at all times whatsoever, and to never have feelings of sadness.</p></li>\n</ol>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>In general, sadness is something to be avoided by anyone trying to serve G-d, like is understood from Tehillim 100:2 which says:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Serve G-d with joy, come before Him with song.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Contrary to what you suggest, There is no \"rebuke\" being made by the Alter Rebbe. He only applies the comparison of being <strong><em>like a heretic</strong>, meaning similar to someone who denies G-d and the Torah</em>, to one who has actually attained the level of comprehension he describes in the opening of the letter and who then indulges in excessive grieving over material hardship.</p>\n\n<p>Even there, he only points out the hypocrisy of denying G-d's goodness for such a person by overindulging in being 'grief-stricken' over material hardship.</p>\n\n<p>He explains this in the context of understanding that because part of our faith is that the universe is created by G-d, <em>Ex Nihilo</em>, meaning from nothingness, constantly, every moment of every day, and that we also believe that nothing negative comes from G-d, like is found in Bereshit Rabbah 51:3, then it is understood that even those things which <strong><em>appear to us</em></strong> as negative, are in truth, only good.</p>\n\n<p>The second part of your question seems to be confusing the difference between <em>mourning</em> which is אבלות, and sadness or depression (עצבות ודאבה).</p>\n\n<p>Mourning is a procedure. It has specific practices which are outlined in halacha about what one is to do or to refrain from doing. In fulfilling those procedures, one has mourned, fulfilled a mitzvah and served G-d.</p>\n\n<p>Sadness and depression are emotional states. They are actual states of being, but are not mitzvot. There is no commandment of G-d to be sad.</p>\n\n<p>The Alter Rebbe clearly acknowledges the obligations for mourning as can be seen, for example, in <a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=42805&st=&pgnum=326\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Siddur Torah Ohr, volume 2, section 6 and 7</a> discussing the laws of mourning. With the petirah of a loved one, most people experience sadness. But to be sad is not some requirement of mourning.</p>\n\n<p>To my knowledge, the Alter Rebbe does not advocate suppressing emotions. What he teaches is that emotion, middot, arise via the intellect (<em>Mochin</em> or <em>Sechel</em>). That is why his school of Chassidic thought is called 'Chabad'. It refers to Wisdom, Understanding and Knowledge (חכמה בינה ודעת), the components of the intellect. It means that part of our Avodah is to strive to use our intellect, each individual according to their unique capacity, to express their emotions properly in service to G-d.</p>\n\n<p>There are two stories which come to mind to help illustrate this idea.</p>\n\n<p>The first is from the bottom of <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Makkot.24a.33?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Makkot 24a and continued on 24b</a>. It recounts two occasions when Rabban Gamliel, Rabbi Elazar ben Azarya, Rabbi Yehoshua, and Rabbi Akiva were walking together along the road. In each circumstance, Rabbi Akiva's response upon seeing a very negative event was laughter from joy, while the other sages cried from sadness.</p>\n\n<p>The difference in emotional response was due to how each individual processed the observation intellectually. With Akiva, he saw in the negative events the revelation of G-d's goodness, meaning that only good comes from Above like is mentioned above from Bereshit Rabbah. With the other sages, that goodness was not perceived. It was concealed from them. As a consequence, they cried in sadness.</p>\n\n<p>The second story recounts what happened when the 5th Lubavitcher Rebbe, Rabbi Shalom Dov Ber Schneerson was passing away in front of his son, the future 6th Rebbe, Rabbi Yosef Yitzchok Schneerson.</p>\n\n<p>The 6th Rebbe was known throughout his youth as being a highly emotional individual. His father had worked with him throughout his life to master his mind, his intellectual powers, in order that his emotions should always express properly in service to G-d.</p>\n\n<p>In these final hours of the 5th Rebbe's life as he lay before his son, he was giving his son final guidance and instructions about becoming Rebbe in the coming hours. In that moment, Rabbi Yosef Yitzchok was overcome with grief and sobbing. As incredible as it may seem, his father, Rabbi Shalom Dov Ber's response to his son was, \"Middot?!...Middot?!...Mochin!\"</p>\n\n<p>With all this, it is important to remember that the Tanya is also called <em>Sefer Shel Benoni</em>, the Book of the Intermediate Person. That means that the level of service to G-d described therein, is attainable by anyone who stands in that middle ground between being totally righteous or the opposite. However, with that said, it also explains that this is a constant, day to day struggle for such people. That is why it is called <em>Avodah</em>, work.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>B\"H</p>\n<p>In Tanya chapter 26 it specifies that one should never be sad about material matters, but regarding one's own sins, one should set aside specific times to be upset about them in order to you teshuva, but not during one's Torah learning or work or davening.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>I do not need to restate the points made in the other answers, I just want to add one definition that might make things clearer.</p>\n<p>According to Chassidus, הָעַצְבוּת, <em>sadness</em>, is <strong>not</strong> an emotion, but rather a disposition of the heart. See <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/a/132888/31534\">this answer</a> for more explanation and sources, but I will summarise here.</p>\n<p>It is part of 3 dispositions:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Simcha - heart open to all emotions, positively</li>\n<li>Merrirut - heart open to all emotions, negatively</li>\n<li>Atzavut - heart closed to all emotions</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The first two are useful in Avodat Hashem and therefore one should work on utilising them in one's service, but 3 is not useful at all (and counter productive) so therefore is meant only to be overcome.</p>\n<p>One should aim to be always open to emotion, and mostly in a positive disposition (<em>b'simcha</em>). Negative disposition serves its purpose, and the proper use is to activate it at set times of Teshuva etc.</p>\n<p>Therefore to answer your points:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>If one is suffering, but is <em>b'simcha</em>, that will stir genuinely heartfelt emotions regarding one's suffering, and at set times one should be bitter about it, which will lead to one genuinely taking action to improve their condition. If one is <em>b'atzuv</em>, one will just feel numb, and nothing will change; they are stuck and disconnected from life. This is something to overcome.</li>\n<li>As mentioned, there are set times for bitterness, but not only that, being <em>b'simcha</em> doesn't mean feeling happy and loving! It means <em>feeling</em>. Only someone <em>b'simcha</em> can truly cry about something tragic (a sad person will not feel much, if anything), and that crying doesn't always have to be <em>bitter</em>. Those who know, know. May we only have <em>simchas</em>.</li>\n</ol>\n\n\n",

Correct me, if am wrong. Please include sources, for my learning.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>The \"old-fashioned\" agunah was one where the husband disappeared at sea or the like, and there's insufficient proof of death. <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/a/85517/21\">As hazoriz mentioned</a>, the Talmud allowed for weaker forms of proof than we might otherwise require, to make it easier for her to remarry. (Still, the rabbis have to be solidly convinced that the husband actually died.) Such questions came up with the sinking of the Titanic, and most recently, on 9/11/2001 with the collapse of the Twin Towers. <a href=\"http://koltorah.org/ravj/Agunot%202.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rabbi Jachter has an article on that one here</a>; Rabbi Mordechai Willig in New York corresponded with Rav Ovadya Yosef zt'l on some of these questions. Hacham Ovadya wrote some similar responsa about Israeli soldiers who went missing in action.</p>\n\n<p>Next comes the case where the husband's sanity is questionable. A rabbi will make the best attempt they can to make a determination on this; Rabbi Moshe Feinstein had to deal with a guy who claimed he was the Mashiach and sometimes walked around naked; he spent hours and hours trying to: a.) determine whether the fellow was sane enough to give a Get b.) convince the fellow to then do so, at which point he immediately handled the Get there in Liuban, even though normally they preferred to go to a bigger city with more of a history of doing Gittin. The Beth Din of America had the sad case of a husband diagnosed with very aggressive Alzheimer's; they said he should give a Get while he still had the mental capacity to do so.</p>\n\n<p>The third case -- and the most common one today -- is where the husband is alive and well, but chooses not to give a Get. Theoretically, in some cases a Bet Din can order \"coercion\" against him, and the Mishna even talks about beating him up. (We then use a very creative reading of what's called \"giving the Get of his own free will!\") In Israel today, <em>if</em> the Bet Din has found \"coercion\" to be called for (and perhaps some <em>batei din</em> could be more courageous about making this decision), the Israeli government can take away the man's passport, driver's license, and ability to hold a bank account. One time he was already in jail, and they took away his television!</p>\n\n<p>In America, the community can and will protest outside the fellow's house and business and otherwise shun him, which American law allows them to do. American law does not allow them to beat up the fellow, so please don't do that. (One rabbi was recently caught by the FBI for this and sent to jail.)</p>\n\n<p>In both England and New York State, rabbis have successfully lobbied to change the law so that the secular courts will not issue a civil divorce until a Get has been given. (There are some fine details, but that's the basic idea.)</p>\n\n<p>Many other options have been considered over the years; for instance, we could pull aside the groom five minutes after the wedding, ask him to write a Get, and then order the rabbi to deliver it to his wife whenever they're no longer happily together. But the best system, emotionally, is what the Torah describes -- <em>if</em> the marriage falls apart, <em>then</em> he does the right thing and gives her a Get.</p>\n\n<p>Really one of the best options right now is the increased push for an agreement <em>before</em> the couple gets married; these create all sorts of strong incentives for him to give a Get when and if it is called for. Many rabbis have worked very hard on formulating these, <a href=\"http://www.rabbis.org/news/article.cfm?id=105949\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">defending them halachically</a>, and pushing for them to be used. And if a woman asks for this before the wedding and her fiance refuses to sign it, that's a big warning sign and she should probably think again about marrying him. The most common one in the US is known as <a href=\"http://theprenup.org/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\"The Beth Din of America prenup\" (sometimes called \"Rabbi Willig's prenup\")</a>; rabbis who belong to the Rabbinical Council of America <a href=\"http://www.rabbis.org/news/article.cfm?id=105863\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">are <em>required</em> to use one of these</a> when performing a wedding. There's <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/q/3806/21\">plenty of discussion</a> <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/16750/marital-prenups\">about it</a> on this website. So far, the BDA prenup has worked every time: <em>if</em> the couple signed one before getting married, then when they got divorced, he has given a Get. There are other forms of agreements, some intended specifically for Israel, as well; though I don't know a lot about their details.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>see end of <a href=\"http://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/957718/jewish/Gerushin-Chapter-Thirteen.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">chapter 13 in rambam gittin</a>  </p>\n\n<p>The last halacha below sums up the answer</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>7\n  If an epidemic was raging throughout the world, and [a woman] says, \"My husband died,\" her word is accepted. For [there is no widely accepted likelihood] with regard to a plague; everyone knows that in a time of plague some die and some live. And it is possible that strong young men will die from the plague, and elderly infirm people will be saved. And therefore, we do not suspect that she relied on the likelihood that most people died.</p>\n  \n  <p>8\n  It has already been stated that a witness who [did not see evidence of the person's death himself, but who] testifies after hearing the statements of another person is acceptable with regard to [the verification of the death of] a woman's [husband].</p>\n  \n  <p>When does this apply? When the person heard a mentally competent adult - even a servant or a maid -servant - say that so and so died. If, however, a person heard from a mentally incompetent person or from a minor that an individual died, he may not testify [to that effect], nor do we rely on their statements.</p>\n  \n  <p>9\n  [There is an exception to the above principle.] If a person heard children saying: \"We just came from so and so's funeral. These and these many people recited eulogies. The sage so and so and these and these others followed the bier. A nd this and this is what happened to the bier,\" the person may offer this as testimony [regarding a man's death], and on this basis permission is granted for [the deceased's] wife to remarry.</p>\n  \n  <p>10\n  When a Jew says, \"I killed so and so,\" [the man's wife] is allowed to remarry on the basis of his testimony. [The rationale is] a person's own testimony cannot be used to incriminate him. [Therefore, he is not disqualified, and] he did testify that [the husband] died.</p>\n  \n  <p>11\n  It has already been stated that statements made by a gentile in the course of conversation can be used as a basis to grant [a woman] permission to remarry.</p>\n  \n  <p>What is implied? If a gentile exclaimed: \"How terrible is it that so and so died! He was so nice! He did so much for me!\" Or if the gentile was talking and said, \"We were traveling on our way, and to our amazement, so and so who was traveling with us fell down and died. We all were amazed that he died so suddenly.\" If he makes statements of this nature that indicate that he has no intention of giving testimony, his word is accepted.</p>\n  \n  <p>12\n  When a Jew hears a gentile [say] in the course of conversation [that a man died], he may testify that he heard these statements, and the man's wife may be granted permission to remarry on this basis.</p>\n  \n  <p>When does the above apply? When there is no rationale to explain [why the gentile would make these statements if they were not true]. If, however, there could be a reason for the gentile's statements, and he is making them with another intent in mind [his word is not accepted].</p>\n  \n  <p>For example, [a gentile] told a Jew, \"Do such and such for me, or else I will kill you, as I killed so and so,\" he is not making these statements in the course of conversation, for his intent is to cast fear upon his listener.</p>\n  \n  <p>13\n  Similarly, if a person heard the gentile legal authorities say, \"We executed so and so,\" their word is not accepted. For they will use falsehood to reinforce their position and to cast fear [among the populace]. The same applies in all similar instances.</p>\n  \n  <p>14\n  When, at first, a gentile made statements in the course of conversation, and afterwards was asked questions [by Jews] until all the details [of the person's death] were disclosed, his statements are accepted, and the woman is granted permission to remarry on this basis.</p>\n  \n  <p>15\n  It has already been stated that a witness who testifies: \"I heard that so and so died,\" is acceptable with regard to testimony [concerning] a woman's [husband], and the woman may remarry on this basis. [This applies even when] he heard the statements from a woman or from a servant.</p>\n  \n  <p>If, however, a witness, a woman or a servant says: \"So and so died; I saw that he died,\" the witness should be asked: \"What did you see? How do you know that he died? \" If the witness responds with clear [testimony], his word is accepted. If the witness replies, describing a situation in which it is highly likely that the person would have died, we do not grant his wife license to remarry. For testimony concerning a man's death [can be accepted] only when [the witness can say] with certainty that he saw the man die, and there is no doubt concerning the matter.</p>\n  \n  <p>16\n  What is implied? If a man was seen falling into the sea, even if he fell into the ocean, testimony should not be offered that the man died, because it is possible that he was cast away or escaped [from the sea] from an [unseen] place.</p>\n  \n  <p>If he fell into a body of water with definite boundaries - e.g., a cistern or a cavern in which a person standing [at the edge] could see the entire periphery - testimony that the man died may be offered, and license may be granted for his wife to remarry, provided [the witnesses] remained there for a period of time beyond which it was impossible for the man to live, and saw that he did not ascend [from the body of water].</p>\n  \n  <p>Similarly, if he was cast into the sea and a net was cast in after him, and a limb that a person would not be able to live without was raised up, testimony may be offered that he died, and his wife may [be granted license] to remarry.</p>\n  \n  <p>17\n  If [a man] fell into a lair of lions, leopards or the like, testimony that he died may not be offered, for it is possible that they will not eat him. If he fell into a pit of snakes and scorpions, into a furnace, or into a boiling caldron filled with wine or oil, or his esophagus and windpipe were slit - either in their majority or in their entirety - testimony may be offered that he died, even if he arose and fled. For [in these situations], he ultimately will die.</p>\n  \n  <p>Similar laws apply in all situations in which it is impossible that the person will live, but rather will die shortly afterwards. Testimony may be offered that he [died].</p>\n  \n  <p>18\n  If we see a man hanging and a vulture eating from his body, testimony may not be offered that he died. [This applies] even if he was stabbed with a lance, or arrows were shot at him.</p>\n  \n  <p>If, however, we see the vulture eating from a place that would cause him to die - e.g., his brain, his heart or his intestines, one may offer testimony that he died.</p>\n  \n  <p>19\n  [The following laws apply when] one witness testifies, \"I saw that he died in a war or in a landslide, or that he drowned in the ocean and died,\" or mentioned other causes that would probably lead to death. If he says, \"I buried him,\" his statements are accepted, and she may be granted permission to remarry. If he did not say, \"I buried him,\" she should not be granted permission to remarry. If, however, she remarries, she need not leave [her second husband].</p>\n  \n  <p>20\n  Similarly, if one witness testifies that a woman's husband drowned in the sea or in a body of water that does not have a defined periphery, he did not emerge [from the water], all traces of him have disappeared, and his existence has been forgotten, the woman should not [be granted license to] remarry on this basis, as we have explained.</p>\n  \n  <p>If, however, she remarries, she need not be forced to leave her second husband. Even if a gentile said in the course of conversation, \"So and so drowned at sea,\" and on this basis [the man's wife] remarried, she need not be forced to leave her second husband. Nevertheless, [in the above instances,] the sage who gave permission for her to remarry should be placed under a ban of ostracism.</p>\n  \n  <p>21\n  [The following rules apply when the body of a man who was] slain or died of natural causes is discovered. If his forehead, his nose and his facial features are intact, and his identity can be established based on them, testimony concerning his death may be offered.</p>\n  \n  <p>If, however, any of these identifying factors is missing, even if there are signs [through which he can be identified] on his body and on his personal artifacts, even if one of those signs is a mole, testimony concerning his death should not be offered.</p>\n  \n  <p>When does [the leniency mentioned in the first clause] apply? When the corpse was seen within three days of his murder or death. After three days have passed, testimony concerning his death should not be offered, because his facial features [may have] become distorted.</p>\n  \n  <p>22\n  [The following rules apply when a man] drowned at sea and was cast out onto dry land. Although several days have passed, if his facial features and his nose can be identified, testimony may be offered with regard to his [death], for in water the features of a corpse do not become distorted until an extremely long period of time has passed.</p>\n  \n  <p>If the corpse lay on dry land for twelve hours after being cast out of the sea and the corpse became bloated, testimony may not be offered because [his features] have been distorted. When we look at the form [of a corpse] in order to identify [a man] to offer testimony with regard to his [death], [it is acceptable if] we look at [the corpse] even by candlelight or by moonlight.</p>\n  \n  <p>23\n  [The following rule applies when] we see a person at a distance and he says that he is so and so, the son of so and so, or so and so from a particular place, and that he has been bitten by a snake and is dying. Even if we go [to the place where he was standing], find [the corpse and discover] that its features have changed to the extent that it is no longer distinguishable, we may, nevertheless, [grant license for] his wife [to] remarry:</p>\n  \n  <p>24\n  [A person's testimony is effective in the following instance.] A person came and said: \"A court - or people - told me, when you arrive at this and this place, tell them that Yitzchak, the son of Michael, died.\" When this person came to that place and delivered the message - although he is not aware of the identity [of the deceased] - since [the people at that place] do know his identity, [the deceased's] wife [may be granted] permission [to remarry]. We do not presume that perhaps it was another person named Yitzchak, the son of Michael, who died.</p>\n  \n  <p>25\n  When a Jew and a gentile left from our [location] for a different destination, and the gentile came and said in the course of conversation: \"The man who left [this city] with me died,\" [the deceased's] wife [may be granted license to] remarry. [This applies] even when the gentile does not know the identity of the man, provided he says: \"I buried him.\"</p>\n  \n  <p>26\n  Similarly, when ten men were taken together while shackled in chains or tied by heavy ropes used to lead camels or the like, from one place to another, and a gentile came and said in the course of conversation that all ten men who went out while tied died, and he buried them, their wives [may be granted license to] remarry.</p>\n  \n  <p>27\n  If a Jew says: \"A Jewish man died in our company in this and this place. These and these were his facial features. These and these were signs of identification,\" we do not make a guess and say that it was probably so and so. Rather [the person is not considered to have died] until a witness mentions his name and the name of his city.</p>\n  \n  <p>If, however, [a person] says: \"One of the inhabitants of the city of so and so journeyed out in our company and died,\" we check in that city. If only one man left the city, his wife [may be given permission to] marry.</p>\n  \n  <p>28\n  [The following rule applies if] a document was found saying: \"So and so, the son of so and so, died,\" or \"So and so, the son of so and so, was killed\": If it can be determined that this was written by a Jew, [the man's] wife [may be given permission to] marry.</p>\n  \n  <p>Similarly, when a person has lost the power of speech, and he was tested, as he would be tested with regard to a get, and it is proven that he is mentally sound, if he writes that so and so died, we may rely on his writing, and [the deceased's] wife [may be given permission to] marry.</p>\n  \n  <p>We do not follow the standard process of interrogation with regard to witnesses who testify [concerning the death of] a woman's [husband]. For our Sages did not speak about establishing stringencies regarding such matters. [Indeed, their approach was characterized by] leniency in order to permit a woman without a husband [to remarry].</p>\n  \n  <p><strong>29</strong>\n  Do not wonder at the fact that our Sages discharged the prohibition [against a married woman], which is considered a very severe matter, on the basis of the testimony of a woman, a servant or a maidservant, statements made by a gentile in the course of conversation, a written statement or [testimony] that was not investigated by the ordinary process of interrogation, as we have explained.\n  [These leniencies were instituted] because the Torah requires only testimony of two witnesses, and all the other details of the laws of witnesses with regard to matters that cannot be verified definitively except via witnesses and their testimony - e.g., that one person killed another, or that one person lent money to another. When, by contrast, the matter may be verified definitively without the testimony of a witness, and the witness cannot justify [his statements] if they are not true - e.g, when one testifies that a person died, the Torah did not necessitate [that the requirements of formal testimony be met in these instances]. For it is unlikely that a witness will testify falsely.\n  For this reason, our Sages [extended] the leniency with regard to this matter and accepted the testimony of a single witness that is based on the testimony of a maidservant, [testimony] from a written document, and [testimony] that was not investigated by the ordinary process of interrogation. [These leniencies were accepted] so that the daughters of Israel will not be forced to remain unmarried.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# discarding hot meat/dairy on top of dairy/meat\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>At lunch at work today, an irreligious Jewish coworker asked a religious one why we don't need separate meat and dairy trash receptacles. After all, we separate meat and dairy otherwise. The religious coworker replied that we don't eat from the trash. But the truth is that <a href=\"/q/38152\">besides the ban on <em>eating</em> meat with dairy, there's a ban on <em>cooking</em> meat with dairy</a>. And, as far as I know (from laws of <em>Shabas</em>, I guess), that includes allowing <a href=\"//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yad_soledet_bo\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><em>yad-soledes-bo</em></a> meat to come into contact with dairy (or vice versa), at least if it's hot enough to make the surface of the latter <em>yad soledes bo</em> also.

If not, why not?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>There are 3 issues with meat and dairy: cooking it, eating it and getting pleasure from a cooked meat and milk mixture (such as feeding an animal a meat/milk combination).\nCooking may be an issue if it is yad soledes bo. So boiling meat sauce should not be poured on top of dairy in your trash can as it can \"cook\" it according to Halacha. So some hold it is an issue so you need to wait for it to cool off before discarding (it might melt your garbage bag anyways so it might be a good idea to cool it down irregardless). (See first article I quoted).</p>\n\n<p>However, some hold that cooking only applies as a preparation for eating and therefore something that could not be eaten would not be an issue.

If I have my tefillin, but no tallit, do I forego the tefillin at shacharit and wait until I have both?</p>\n\n<p>And, of course, is any of this changed by my wearing a tallit kattan?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>As codified in Shulchan Aruch (OC <a href=\"https://he.wikisource.org/wiki/%D7%A9%D7%95%D7%9C%D7%97%D7%9F_%D7%A2%D7%A8%D7%95%D7%9A_%D7%90%D7%95%D7%A8%D7%97_%D7%97%D7%99%D7%99%D7%9D_%D7%99%D7%98\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">19:1</a>) the requirement to don <em>tzitzit</em> is an obligation on the individual, i.e. when one wears a garment which meets the requirements of the laws of <em>tzitzit</em> he is then obligated to attach the strings. One is not obligated to purchase a kosher garment bearing <em>tzitzit</em> in order to fulfill the commandment (cf. Beer Heitiv <a href=\"http://beta.hebrewbooks.org/tursa.aspx?a=oc_x371\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">OC 17:2</a>), however it is preferable to do so as it is of great significance (see SA <a href=\"https://he.wikisource.org/wiki/%D7%A9%D7%95%D7%9C%D7%97%D7%9F_%D7%A2%D7%A8%D7%95%D7%9A_%D7%90%D7%95%D7%A8%D7%97_%D7%97%D7%99%D7%99%D7%9D_%D7%9B%D7%93_%D7%90\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">ibid. 24:1</a>; the rabbis have much discussion about the notion of proactively obligating oneself in <em>mitzvot</em> generally but that is off topic).

Rabbi Zeira objects to this statement of Rav: ‎In accordance with whose opinion among the tanna’im does Rav’s halakha correspond? It is in accordance with the opinion of Rabbi Meir, who said as a principle that the hand of a woman is like the hand of her husband. According to Rabbi Meir, a slave has no independent right of acquisition, and anything given to a slave belongs to his master even if it was stipulated otherwise (see Kiddushin 23b). Rav assumes that similarly, a married woman has no independent right of acquisition, but rather, anything that she attempts to acquire for herself is automatically acquired by her husband.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The Gemara subsequently poses a technical issue regarding a discussion in Eiruvin, which indicates that that which is given to a woman does <em>not</em> go to the husband. The Gemara ultimately answers:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>אלא אמר רב אשי  מתניתין בשיש לה חצר באותו מבוי עסקינן דמגו דזכיא לנפשה זכיא לאחריני</p>\n  \n  <p>‎Rather, Rav Ashi said: In the mishna in Eiruvin, we are dealing with a woman who possesses a courtyard of her own in that alleyway, i.e., it is a case where the husband had earlier stipulated that she should have property of her own, to which he renounces all his rights. As, since she acquires the eiruv food for herself by virtue of the courtyard that she owns in that alleyway, she likewise acquires it for others.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>In summary, therefore, according to Rebbi Meir, according to Rav, a woman acquires for her husband unless the gift was specifically given for her to his exclusion, or unless it was placed in property that she owns independently of her husband (יד אשה כיד בעלה). Shmuel holds that she never acquires on his behalf; as Rashi there explains, Shmuel does not hold of יד אשה כיד בעלה. </p>\n\n<p>As we pasken like Shmuel by monetary matters (Rambam paskens like him in Nedarim 7:17 and Zechi’ah U’matanah 3:14), giving to the woman is not a valid way to give to the husband. </p>\n\n<p>Even if one made the woman a messenger on your behalf (“this belongs to your husband; can you please give this to him for me?”), the item is still considered in your property, as she is your messenger (a messenger of a person is like him - Kiddushin 41a).</p>\n\n<p>So, to directly answer your question, giving to her is not like giving to him. </p>\n\n\n",

For example, here is the first occurrence:</p>\n\n<p>וַיְבָרֶךְ אֹתָם אֱלֹהִים, לֵאמֹר:</p>\n\n<p>Knowing that no words in the Torah are unnecessary makes it more intriguing to me to find out what the real meaning of this word is. </p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Yoma.4b.11?lang=he\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Yoma 4b</a> says that it is a grant of permission to tell it over to others (without that, it would have been meant only for the listener's ears):</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>אמר ר' (מוסיא בר בריה דרבי מסיא משמיה דר' מוסיא) רבה מניין לאומר דבר לחבירו שהוא בבל יאמר עד שיאמר לו לך אמור שנאמר (ויקרא א, א) וידבר ה' אליו מאהל מועד לאמר </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n### ✅ Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>The Sifra at the beginning of Vayikra writes that the word ‘leimor’ should be understood as ‘in order to say’, i.e. in order to repeat over to the Jewish People. </p>\n\n<p>The Ramban in Shemos, 6, 10, brings this explanation but points out that it does not work in all cases. He therefore states, “What is correct in my eyes is that the word ‘leimor’ is to indicate clarification of the matter in all places, and God spoke to Moshe in a complete statement and not a doubtful statement, and not hinting any matters.”</p>\n\n<p>HaKesav VeHaKabbalah argues that there are cases where the Ramban’s explanation also doesn’t work such as Lemech calling his son Noach (Bereishis 5, 29) then adding “leimor…” and cites a few other examples such as the beginning of the Aseres Hadibros (Ten Commandments) where the word leimor is used, though it seems superfluous to say ‘with clarity’. In Shemos 20, 1, he therefore takes the Ramban's idea a bit further and says that the word leimor comes to indicate further explanation and details given over. I.e. the word ‘vayedaber’ or ‘vayomer’ would mean to explain the kelalim - the general principles, and ‘leimor’ would mean to explain the peratim - the finer details of the mitzvos. In Vayikra 1, 1, he gives a similar explanation that the word ‘amirah’ in general (and as used in the word leimor) is to indicate greater depth of understanding. He cites the Vilna Gaon who said that ‘dibur’ is the statement of the Torah as it is written before us, while ‘amirah’ is the inner depth of the Torah and its intent and rationale. At his conclusion, he also cites Naftali Hertz Weisel who understood these words to mean the opposite - dibur (vayedaber) is used to indicate the Torah sheb’al peh, whereas amirah (leimor) is used for Torah shebichsav.</p>\n\n<p>Sifra, Vayikra - see “davar acher…” (sorry, you'll have to copy & paste this link) -\n<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Sifra,_Vayikra_Dibbura_d\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://www.sefaria.org/Sifra,_Vayikra_Dibbura_d</a>'Nedavah,_Chapter_2.13?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en</p>\n\n<p>Ramban, Shemos 6, 10 - <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Ramban_on_Exodus.6.10.1/en/Sefaria_Community_Translation?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://www.sefaria.org/Ramban_on_Exodus.6.10.1/en/Sefaria_Community_Translation?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en</a></p>\n\n<p>HaKesav VeHaKabbalah, Shemos 20, 1 - <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/HaKtav_VeHaKabalah,_Exodus.20.1.1?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://www.sefaria.org/HaKtav_VeHaKabalah,_Exodus.20.1.1?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en</a></p>\n\n<p>HaKesav VeHaKabbalah, Vayikra, 1, 1 - <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/HaKtav_VeHaKabalah,_Leviticus.1.1.5?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://www.sefaria.org/HaKtav_VeHaKabalah,_Leviticus.1.1.5?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en</a></p>\n\n\n",

Had the Torah said \"ask\" twice where its meaning could have gotten across saying it only once, that would have been noteworthy.</p>\n\n<p>I would add that the single instance of \"ask\" possibly connotes a unified educational experience, including both the father and the elders. <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samson_Raphael_Hirsch\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">R' Samson Raphael Hirsch</a>'s commentary on this verse, <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Deuteronomy.32.7\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Deuteronomy 32:7</a>, describes complementary lessons to be sought from your father and from the elders regarding the history of humanity:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>When you ask your father about history, \"he will relate it to you\" - \"ויגדך,\" which is the same verb as Hagada, the process of telling the Exodus story on Passover. Your father, says R' Hirsch, is meant to \"make [human history] vividly realistic to you,\" presumably employing his special parental understanding of what storytelling style will best capture your interest.</p></li>\n<li><p>When you then turn to the elders, their job is to \"explain\" (R' Hirsch's translation here of \"ויאמרו\") how to apply the lessons we can learn from this history.

It's all one educational mission, so it's appropriate to say \"ask\" once.</p>\n\n\n",

Another example would be the injunction against having too many wives or horses etc.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: -1)\n\n<p>In short, In my understanding there are two kind of Kings and commentators are using them interchangeably:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Kings de facto - anointed de facto. This does not have to be rightful or Torah-approved, like the lineage of kings of Israel (vs Judeah), Maccabean \"Kings\" etc.</li>\n<li>Kings de jure - \"born to be kings\", like Abraham, Judah, Moses, Joshua, David. They were called \"kings\" from birth.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>THis is the reason the commentaries let the later behave like kings and judge others to deaths.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: -1)\n\n<p>You find that Shmuel Hanovi appointed Dovid as King WHILE SHAUL HAMELECH WAS STILL KING,so the Meforshim in Shmuel Aleph ask how was this possible based on the above Klal of Chazal that its not possible for 2 Kings to rule at the same time so they answer that while technically Dovid had been appointed with the Shemen Hamishchoh while Shaul was still King but Dovid had not yet been widely accepted by Am Yisroel as their king and it was only at the end of Shmuel Aleph after Shoul had been killed by the Pelishtim and at the beginning of Shmuel Beys where Dovid makes the Kinoh for Shaul that Klal Yisroel as it were accept Dovid as their new king</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Why does G-d reward reshaim in this world to punish them in the next, if He is good?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>The question of \"Why do some reshaim people live a good life, while some good people suffer\" is often answered that G-d rewards the rasha in this world, in order to punish him in the world to come for all his sins.</p>\n\n<p>How can we reconcile this with the concept that G-d is essentially good and that everything He does is for the good [of every individual] (as it says, for instance, \"Tov Hashem lakol vrachamov al kol maasov\"). Now, being rewarded in this world in order to be punished in the world to come surely seems like <em>not</em> a good thing for the rasha (in an absolute good sense). So why would G-d do that?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>In order to answer why God would do it we have to explain why we think He shouldn't do it. I assume that the reason why you (and probably most others) feel that He shouldn't do it is that you feel that reward in this world and reward in the next world are not equal. That being the case, we can ask the question more directly:</p>\n\n<p>Let the designated reward for a mitzvah = X. If the threshold of X can be attained in this world then what is the difference whether a rasha receives it in this world or the next world? Either way he gets X. If the threshold of X cannot be reached in this world, then how can any good he receives in this world cancel out his reward in the next world? He earned X and he still hasn't gotten it! </p>\n\n<p>Instead of asking <strong>why</strong> <strong>God would</strong> do it, we are really asking <strong>how God could</strong> do it. </p>\n\n<p>The Chofetz Chaim actually answers both of these questions (separately, and makes no connection between them) although I don't think that either answer really suffices.</p>\n\n<p><strong>First, the answer to why:</strong></p>\n\n<p>He explains with a parable of a house on fire with all the valuables cast outside. Normally valuables are kept inside the house, but when there is a fire the valuables have to be cast outside so they don't get destroyed. Similarly, mitzvos are normally kept in the next world. But when a rasha commits sins, it is like lighting the house on fire, and the mitzvos have to be cast outside, i.e. to this world. Thus God rewards the rasha in this world. </p>\n\n<p><strong>שם עולם חלק שני שער ההתחזקות פרק ד</strong></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>והנה ליראיו הצפין הקב\"ה טובתם לעולם הבא אבל אלו שנסוגים מאחרי ה' נותן\n  להם בעולם הזה עבור איזה מצוה שעשו ונבאר סיבת הדבר בדרך משל אחד שאמר\n  לרעהו הנה נשמע שיש שריפה בעיר נבוא לגביר פלוני קרובי להציל רכושו מן\n  האש ויהי בבואם לחצרו מצאו שכל כלי הבית היקרים כגון מורה השעות הטוב\n  והארגז עם התכשיטים הושלכו לחצר ויכה כף על כף יאמר לו מה ראית רען תאמר\n  לו מאץ באו הכלים היקרים האלו לפה והלא דרכם להיות בהיכל הפנימי אלא ודאי\n  ששם שלטה האש בקירותיו והושלכו לפה להציל לכל הפחות את התכשיטים וכן הדבר\n  בעניננו לכלל ישראל יש להם טרקלין למעלה ומכל תורה ומצות שמקיימים נבראים\n  מהן כמה מיני עידון ותענוג ומזומנים שם בטרקלין בשביל המקיימן שיתעדן שם\n  כשימלאו ימיו וכמו שכתוב צדיק כתמר יפרח וגו' שתילים בבית ה' וגו' אבל\n  האנשים שפרקו מעל עצמם עול מלכות שמים כבר נשרף ונתקלקל הטרקלין שלהם\n  למעלה וממילא המעט מצות שעשו בקטנותם כגון מצות מילה וכדומה הושלכו לחוץ\n  לפרוזדור שהוא העולם הזה שיתעדנו מהן</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>This doesn't really explain why God set up the system this way, nor does it address how God is \"cheating\" the rasha out of his full reward.</p>\n\n<p><strong>The answer to how:</strong></p>\n\n<p>This too is explained by a parable. A hundred counterfeit monetary documents are only worth one real monetary document. A real document containing the King's seal can be redeemed in the king's treasury, for a full sum of money, whereas a counterfeit document can only be redeemed for a few pennies on the black market. Similarly, mitzvos done lishmah carry the seal of God. They can be redeemed in the king's treasury (the next world). Mitzvos done by reshaim are not lishmah, and thus do not have God's seal. As counterfeit mitzvos, they can only be redeemed in the black market (this world) at a fraction of the value.</p>\n\n<p><strong>שם עולם חלק ראשון שער שמירת השבת פרק ה</strong></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>עוד נראה לי לבאר כוונה עמוקה בזה המאמר שיהיה תפוס בידו מה שלמד כדי שלא\n  השיגנו בושה וכלימה ליום הדין והוא בהקדם מה ששמעתי בשם גאון אחד שלפיכך\n  אין נותנין שכר המצות בעולם הזה מפני שבעולם הזה אין מקום לעריכת השולחן\n  לעושי המצות שהלא יפה שעה אחת של קורת רוח בעולם הבא מכל היי העולם הוה\n  והקשיתי אם כן איך יצוייר מה שאמר הכתוב ומשלם לשונאיו אל פניו להאבידו\n  דהיינו שמשלם להם שכר צדקתם בעולם הזה וכפירוש רש\"י שם והתרגוסן והלא אין\n  מקום לתשלומין פה ונראה לי לבאר בדרך משל איש אחד רמאי פיתה קצין אחד\n  שיקנה מאתו מאה שטרות מזוייפים שוייף שטרי המלך וכאשר נתן לו הקצין מחירם\n  כנגדם שטר אהד אמיתי שאל אותו הלא אנכי נתתי לך מאה שטרות ואתה פוטרני\n  באחד השיב לו הוי סבל התדמה מעותיך למעותי הלא שלך מזויפים אבל שטרי הוא\n  אמת ויען אותו הרמאי מאי נפקא מיניה זה נייר וזה נייר השיב לו הוי פתי\n  ושוטה הלא שטרי אני יכול להובילו לאוצר המלך לפורטו שם בכל מטבע שארצה\n  ויקבלו אותי בסבר פנים יפות אבל שטרותיך המזויפים אם אכניס אותם לשם\n  יכירו מיד את הזיוף שאין שם המלך חתום עליהם ואתחייב ראשי למלך ולא אוכל\n  להוציאם כי אם בחורים וסדקים ואינם שוים כי אם איזה פרוטות כן הדבר ממש\n  בענייננו המצות אשה עם ה' עושים בודאי הם עושים אותם מפני רצון השם יתברך\n  שצוה אותם על זה ובודאי חתום השם יתברך על ענין זה כמו שאמרו חז\"ל במד\"ר\n  רות פ\"ה כשאדם עושה מצוה אליהו כותבה ומלך המשיח והקב\"ה חותם על ידיהם\n  הדא הוא דכתיב אז נדברו יראי ה' איש אל רעהו וגו' ויכתב ספר זכרון לפניו\n  וגו' וכעין רמז לזה יש גם כן בתורה שכתוב על כמה מצות בסופן אני ה ודרשו\n  על זה אני ה' נאמן לשלם שכר והוא כעין חתימה שחותם המלך על שטרותיו ובשטר\n  כזה אם יובא למעלה בודאי תיכף ישולם שנרו בכבוד גדול ויפה שעה אחת של\n  קורת רוח בעולם הבא מכל חיי העולם הזה ובודאי אין מקום לתשלומי שטר כזה\n  פה וכנ\"ל אבל לא כן מי שהוא רשע מסתמא מצותיו המעטות שחם לה לא עוטה\n  לכבוד השם יתברך כלל ורק לאתה פניה וכבוד ובודאי אין שם השם יתברך חתום\n  על מצוה כזו והוא כשטר מזויף שאין המלה התום עליו וכשיובא לעולם האמת שטר\n  כזה אין שוה כלום ואדרבה יתעורר עליו רוגזו של המלך על שטרות כאלו ועל זה\n  אמרתי בדרך רמז מה דאיתא באבות פרק ראשון הוא היה אומר אם אין אני לי מי\n  לי רוצה לומר אם שמו של הקב\"ה שהוא אני כמו שפירש\"י בסוכה דף ס\"ה שהוא\n  אחד מע\"ב שמות אם אינו חתום על מצותי מי מהמלאכים יוכל לעשות לי שום טובה\n  ואמר עוד וכשאני לעצמי מה אני רוצה לומר אם הקב\"ה יביט רק על עצמי ולא\n  יצרף לי זכות אבות מה אני חשוב במעשי אך מפני גודל טובו וחסדו של הקג\"ה\n  אינו מקפח שכר כל בריה ואפילו של אדם רשע לכן גם לו ישולם שכר אך מקום\n  התשלומין בעבורם הוא בעלמא דשיקרא מפני שנעשו בשקר ומירמה ולכן יש גבול\n  לתשלומין וזהו שאמר המדרש שיראה האדם שיוכל לתפוס מה שלמד גידו שלא\n  יתבייש להראותו לפני פמליא של מעלה בשעה שיאמרו לו עמוד וערוך מקרא שקרית\n  וערוך משנה ששנית והיינו דאם לימודו יהיה לשם קינטור או לאיזה פניה דאם\n  לומד סתמא גם כן טוב הוא דסתמא לשמה קאי בודאי תשיגנו בושה וכלימה\n  בהראותו שם את סחורותיו אלו הנבזות</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>(The Chofetz Chaim reiterates this in Nidchei Yisrael Chapter 38.)</p>\n\n<p>To me it sounds like this is just a way of saying that a rasha's mitzvah is actually worth less, and is not good enough to earn reward in the next world, because it is not done lishmah. But if a rasha did actually do a mitzvah lishmah then he would not receive its reward in this world, because in that case he would not be receiving the correct reward. In other words, it is not that God goes out of his way to hurt reshaim by giving them reward in this world; it is simply that for the most part their mitzvos are only worth reward in this world.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>the rasha has no business in the next world. he is unfit to derive enjoyment there.

Altogether \"קָמוּ בָנֶיהָ\". </p>\n\n<p>Her children בָנֶיהָ [from the word \"Ben\" (that is, at least, a male {ZaKaR}] are a Memory {ZeKeR} (or future memorials) of the Fathers. Therefore, whatever the married mother does for the children, she is in effect also doing it for the children's father (or vice versa).</p>\n\n<p>They are appreciative, as well as her husband:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>קָמוּ בָנֶיהָ, וַיְאַשְּׁרוּהָ;    בַּעְלָהּ, וַיְהַלְלָהּ.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>If a woman had such a mother, would not such a woman want to imitate her mother? </p>\n\n<p>Does everything in the Torah or Tanakh have to begin with \"Thou shalt ...\" before we accept or follow certain actions as (if it were) a Mitzvah (Commandment)?  </p>\n\n<p>Also, in the parasha about Abraham driving Hagar and Ishmael away, it says that Hagar (the mother) looked for or took a wife for Ishmael. This answers part of the question about what a mother does, and up to how old she should care for or raise her child? In this case, until he is old enough to get married:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>וַיֵּ֖שֶׁב בְּמִדְבַּ֣ר פָּארָ֑ן וַתִּקַּח־ל֥וֹ אִמּ֛וֹ אִשָּׁ֖ה\n  מֵאֶ֥רֶץ מִצְרָֽיִם:</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Another biblical fact about what a mother and a father make themselves responsible for: </p>\n\n<p>In the story of Shimshon, the same thing: BOTH the mother and father make themselves responsible to take a wife for their son.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>וַיַּ֗עַל וַיַּגֵּד֙ לְאָבִ֣יו וּלְאִמּ֔וֹ וַיֹּ֗אמֶר אִשָּׁ֛ה\n  רָאִ֥יתִי בְתִמְנָ֖תָה מִבְּנ֣וֹת פְּלִשְׁתִּ֑ים וְעַתָּ֕ה\n  קְחוּ־אוֹתָ֥הּ לִּ֖י לְאִשָּֽׁה:</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Shimshon said, קְחוּ־אוֹתָ֥הּ, talking to both his father & mother. </p>\n\n<p>Also the next verse says, both the father & the mother respond, again showing the mother is also responsible in looking for a wife to a son, who is old enough for nisuin. This answers part of the question about what a mother does, and up to how old she should care for or raise her child? In this case, until he is old enough to get married. </p>\n\n<p>When does a parent's (father's / mother's) soul stop binding up with the child's soul? In regards to Benjamin, he was already married with children and yet his father's (our father Israel's) soul was still bound up with Benjamin's: </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Bereishith 44:30,  וְעַתָּה, כְּבֹאִי אֶל-עַבְדְּךָ אָבִי, וְהַנַּעַר,\n  אֵינֶנּוּ אִתָּנוּ; וְנַפְשׁוֹ, קְשׁוּרָה בְנַפְשׁוֹ.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>This is Israel, or Jacob, who suffered \"Tzaar gidul banim\".</p>\n\n<p>Your questions were: </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>What is \"raising children\"?

I asked them to source it, and they're still looking.</p>\n\n<p>Is there any source that <em>Lechem Mishnah</em> must be cut with a knife? Alternatively, do any sources say one may break the <em>Lechem Mishnah</em> with his hand?</p>\n\n<p>This <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/4601\">related question</a> asks <strong>why</strong> people are insistent to cut the bread with a knife, whereas I'm looking specifically for <strong>sources</strong> discussing it.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>There doesn't appear to be any specific halacha stating that one must use a knife to cut the bread. The general terminology, as you have found in your linked question, which has an answer citing O.C. 167 is  בציעה which means \"breaking\" (or \"breakage\"). And, you will see the term חותך which means \"cutting\". But there's nothing that specifically states that one must use a knife to do the job.</p>\n\n<p>I have been to a number of <em>Chassidsih Tisch's</em> and I have seen rebbes do both. I think the Bobover rebbe used his hands, and someone else (can't recall which rebbe it was, offhand) sliced the challah.</p>\n\n<p>But, what convinces me most that you don't need a knife is that on Pesach, you need <em>lechem mishneh</em> (well, technically during the Seder, you have 3 matzot, but that's for a different purpose.) Are you slicing the matzah with a knife? If you are, please inform us who wins - the matzah or the knife :-)</p>\n\n\n",

Mitzvot batellim doesn't mean that we will start eating pig etc (unless they start chewing the cud in the days of Moshiach?).

Hence the \"obligation\" part will simply fall away.</p>\n<p>So therefore, Hashem will communicate this by shechting the yeitzer hara, and then we will feel it in our bones. No prophet necessary :)</p>\n<p>The reason why Chabad do not entertain the idea that mitzvot will be annulled is because according to Kabbalah, the mitzvot are Hashem's absolute will, so to speak. He wants them, they are \"natural to Him\" so to speak, just like they are natural to the Jewish people's neshama.

Someone told me it would be okay as long as the speaker doesn't touch the microphone or the slides computer, but that doesn't seem right. Wouldn't there be a problem with the lecture itself? </p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>(Of course, for any practical ruling, please consult your local Orthodox Rabbi)</p>\n\n<p>Assuming that all technical prohibitions are avoided (which is in itself quite difficult; even if, using your example, you don't change the slides on the computer, it might be forbidden to have a non-Jew move through the slides on your behalf as you speak. But the details of that are beyond the scope of this answer), this would likely still be forbidden.</p>\n\n<p>There are a number of \"catch-all\" prohibitions on Shabbos that prohibit one from doing actions that, while no Melachos are being violated, is forbidden for being not in the \"Spirit of Shabbos\". This is learnt out from the verse in <a href=\"http://mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt1058.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Isaiah 58:13</a></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>If thou turn away thy foot because of the sabbath, from pursuing thy business on My holy day; and call the sabbath a delight, and the holy of the LORD honourable; and shalt honour it, not doing thy wonted ways, nor pursuing thy business, <strong>nor speaking thereof</strong>; </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>One of the things we learn from that verse is that one is forbidden from speaking about business related matters on Shabbos. Presumably, your example would fall under the general umbrella of speech that is forbidden on Shabbos.</p>\n\n<p>See <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Shulchan_Arukh%2C_Orach_Chayim.306?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Shulchan Aruch Orach Chaim Siman 306</a> for a more detailed treatment of the prohibition of forbidden speech on Shabbos.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>The interdict \"nor pursuing thy business, nor speaking thereof\" (trans. from @Salmononius2) is indeed a general umbrella. For example, business-related documents are forbidden to read on Sabbath (TB Sab. <a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/shas.aspx?mesechta=2&daf=149&format=pdf\" rel=\"noreferrer\">149a</a>). The reason for this is of dispute; some apply the aforementioned interdict (Rosh, Sab. <a href=\"https://he.wikisource.org/wiki/%D7%A8%D7%91%D7%99%D7%A0%D7%95_%D7%90%D7%A9%D7%A8_%D7%A2%D7%9C_%D7%94%D7%A9%22%D7%A1/%D7%A9%D7%91%D7%AA/%D7%A4%D7%A8%D7%A7_%D7%9B%D7%92\" rel=\"noreferrer\">23:1</a>) while others forbid it as a precaution so one does not mistakenly feel it's weekday and erase [writing] (Rambam, Sab., <a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/rambam.aspx?sefer=3&hilchos=12&perek=23&halocha=19&hilite=\" rel=\"noreferrer\">23:19</a>). Some even advance that it is only forbidden to orally read such material (Mordechai, Sab., §254), yet, most authorities side with the Shulchan Aruch that even not orally is forbidden (OC <a href=\"https://he.wikisource.org/wiki/%D7%A9%D7%95%D7%9C%D7%97%D7%9F_%D7%A2%D7%A8%D7%95%D7%9A_%D7%90%D7%95%D7%A8%D7%97_%D7%97%D7%99%D7%99%D7%9D_%D7%A9%D7%96_%D7%99%D7%92\" rel=\"noreferrer\">307:13</a>).</p>\n\n<p>However, IMHO a lecture would fall into more defined parameters. SA (ibid. <a href=\"https://he.wikisource.org/wiki/%D7%A9%D7%95%D7%9C%D7%97%D7%9F_%D7%A2%D7%A8%D7%95%D7%9A_%D7%90%D7%95%D7%A8%D7%97_%D7%97%D7%99%D7%99%D7%9D_%D7%A9%D7%96_%D7%99%D7%96\" rel=\"noreferrer\">307:17</a>) advances an opinion that it is forbidden to learn anything -including educational material- except Torah on Sabbath and holidays. Then, he cites a dissenting opinion which allows such study. The Mishneh Berurah (loc. cit. <a href=\"https://he.wikisource.org/wiki/%D7%9E%D7%A9%D7%A0%D7%94_%D7%91%D7%A8%D7%95%D7%A8%D7%94_%D7%A2%D7%9C_%D7%90%D7%95%D7%A8%D7%97_%D7%97%D7%99%D7%99%D7%9D_%D7%A9%D7%96#.D7.A1.D7.A2.D7.99.D7.A3_.D7.99.D7.96\" rel=\"noreferrer\">65</a>) notes that the lenient view is more prevalent.</p>\n\n<p>Furthermore, OP indicated in a comment that the topic of this lecture would be medical-related. The study of such material is even considered by some to be a <em>mitzvah</em> (as it can enable one to save a life; cf. Rashba <a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=1376&pgnum=177\" rel=\"noreferrer\">1:415</a>, Chazon Ovadiah, Shabbat vol. 3 pg. 32). R. Yitzchok Zilberstien permits one to partake in a medical lecture provided the technical issues are taken care of/avoided (Shiurei Torah LeRof'im, vol. 1 pg. 103). Rabbi Dr. Abraham (Lev Avraham vol. 2 pg. 58) also permits one to partake in such a lecture (though advises not to ask a non-Jew, on Sabbath, to take notes for him). R. Elchanan Prins (Avnei Derech vol. 8 <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=55586&st=&pgnum=234\" rel=\"noreferrer\">314</a>) discusses a question where a rabbi was giving a medical lecture at a seminar on Sabbath and during summation noticed a [Jewish] member in the audience taking notes. The rabbi was posed with the question how to proceed. R. Prins cites numerous personal correspondence that he conducted with rabbis (containing different suggestions) while none raised an issue with having the lecture.    </p>\n\n\n",

I'm assuming this is a known argument which I'm just unfamiliar with the source.</p>\n\n<p>When I speak of Baal Teshuva I specifically mean a Jew who was born and raised in a secular household. <strong><em>Not a Jew who was religious, left, and then came back years later.</em></strong></p>\n\n<p>The argument that was made was that while all Jews are given the same commandments, Hashem holds different Jews to different standards of reward and punishment based upon their upbringing. </p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p><strong>A Baal Teshuva</strong> would be held to a different standard from a typical Jew because their situation is rooted in correcting a mistake.

This means that they are held to a higher standard of judgement based on the fact they couldn't claim ignorance or fighting a previous assimilation. The layout of their upbringing would mean their mistakes are held more against them while their successes aren't as successful as the Baal Teshuva. </p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Now I have previously heard a similar argument with regards to assimilated Jews. The argument basically being that Hashem doesn't hold the children to highly assimilated Jews accountable to the same degree because they were raised in ignorance. This is the argument I'm aware of.</p>\n\n<p>What I hadn't heard before was the idea that after this type of Jew is weaned back into the faith, their successes are greater and their losses aren't as heavily emphasized. Their existence as a Jew at all is effectively a miracle onto itself and thus being a lackluster Jew is better than being no Jew at all.</p>\n\n<p>I was curious if this was an exaggeration on the part of the person who argued this point or if there is a clear source for this point.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 5)\n\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eliyahu_Eliezer_Dessler\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rabbi Dessler</a> in Michtav Me'Eliyahu explains that a person has a nekudat habechira at which he is tested.

    "content": "# Why is Sabbath so important?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>In Isaiah <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Isaiah.58.13?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">58:13-14</a> we read: </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>“If you turn away your foot from the Sabbath,<br>\n  From doing your pleasure on My holy day,<br>\n  And call the Sabbath a delight,<br>\n  The holy day of the Lord honorable,<br>\n  And shall honor Him, not doing your own ways,<br>\n  Nor finding your own pleasure,<br>\n  Nor speaking your own words,<br>\n  Then you shall delight yourself in the Lord;<br>\n  And I will cause you to ride on the high hills of the earth,<br>\n  And feed you with the heritage of Jacob your father.<br>\n  The mouth of the Lord has spoken.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>What a promise! A great blessing hinges on honoring the Sabbath. But why? I understand the Sabbath was established at creation. We rest because God rested, and certainly, we need rest for many reasons. Further, we need time to detach from our earthly concerns to dwell upon godly concerns. The benefits seem self-evident (<em>delight in the Lord</em>), but limited to spiritual well-being; being at peace with God. But this promise is more than that (<em>ride high on the hills, feed on Jacob's heritage</em>), so why does the Sabbath make or break it? </p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>First, let me note that the passage you quoted comes after some other Divine expectations.  It's not saying that <em>only</em> Shabbat is important, but it clearly is saying that Shabbat <em>is</em> important.  I'll focus on Shabbat here since that's what you asked about, but I do encourage you to read the whole chapter for additional context.</p>\n\n<p>God tells Moshe in the torah that Shabbat is a sign between God and Israel.  While all <em>mitzvot</em> and all special days (like festivals) are important, only Shabbat gets this specific designation.  We are to set aside even the work of building the <em>mishkan</em>, God's \"dwelling place\" on Earth, and the penalty for violating Shabbat is death and having one's soul cut off.  From <a href=\"http://www.mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt0231.htm#13\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Shemot 31:13</a>-17:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>'Speak thou also unto the children of Israel, saying: Verily ye shall keep My sabbaths, for it is a sign between Me and you throughout your generations, that ye may know that I am the LORD who sanctify you.<br>\n  Ye shall keep the sabbath therefore, for it is holy unto you; every one that profaneth it shall surely be put to death; for whosoever doeth any work therein, that soul shall be cut off from among his people. [...]<br>\n  Wherefore the children of Israel shall keep the sabbath, to observe the sabbath throughout their generations, for a perpetual covenant.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Rashi says about the sign: </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>For it is a sign between Me and you: It is a sign of distinction between us that I have chosen you, by granting you as an inheritance My day of rest for [your] rest.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Whole books have been written on the spiritual benefits of Shabbat.  I humbly add an idea of my own: one purpose of a sign is to <em>be visible</em>.  Shabbat is a regular, weekly occurrence -- way more visible both to Jews and others than festivals and other special days.  Shabbat is a regular event, which requires special care.  It's pretty much impossible to be Shabbat-observant \"stealthily\" -- by committing to Shabbat you're telling your employer, your customers (if you own a business), your neighbors, your friends, and anybody else who knows you that you keep Shabbat, which you do because you keep the torah that God gave us.  As somebody who did not always keep Shabbat (and is still learning some of the finer points), I can tell you that having to make this weekly affirmation strengthens my dedication and resolve.</p>\n\n<p>And it's not just about individual benefits.  The whole community stopped building the <em>mishkan</em> to keep Shabbat.  Our whole communities leave work, close businesses, set aside computers, and come together on Shabbat, ideally to make it a delight, but also to help and reinforce each other.  I think one of the reasons that Shabbat hospitality is such a common thing when doing outreach (<em>kiruv</em>) is that it ties people who are a little more marginal into a community doing Shabbat.</p>\n\n<p>The command to keep Shabbat gets extra emphasis from God compared to other <em>mitzvot</em>.  Shabbat is a sign, a public declaration, and a frequent occurrence.  It enriches the individual and the community.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>A proper answer to this question would fill books. I will focus on the scripture you referred to. </p>\n\n<p>There are promises and blessings associated with keeping the Sabbath. The Lord will:</p>\n\n<p>1) cause (the Sabbath keeper) to ride upon the high places of the earth, \n2) feed (the Sabbath keeper) with the heritage of Jacob. </p>\n\n<p>These blessings relate to our relationship with the Lord and the Torah.</p>\n\n<p>1) The \"high places\" in the Tanakh are nearly universally sites of idolatry and therefore the subject of great condemnation. But the Tanakh also mentions, the high places as the Lord's domain:</p>\n\n<p>Job 25:2 KJV - Dominion and fear [are] with him, he maketh peace in his high places.</p>\n\n<p>Amos 4:13 KJV - For, lo, he that formeth the mountains, and createth the wind, and <strong>declareth unto man what [is] his thought</strong>, that maketh the morning darkness, and <strong>treadeth upon the high places of the earth</strong>, The LORD, The God of hosts, [is] his name.</p>\n\n<p>In Amos 4 (above) we have a connection between the Lord's creation, His giving man His word and the high places (which in my opinion is metaphorically, where we meet God).</p>\n\n<p>Also, see:</p>\n\n<p>Psalm 18:32-33 KJV - [It is] God that girdeth me with strength, and maketh my way perfect. He maketh my feet like hinds' [feet], and setteth me upon my high places.</p>\n\n<p>Habakkuk 3:19 KJV - The LORD God [is] my strength, and he will make my feet like hinds' [feet], and he will make me to walk upon mine high places. </p>\n\n<p>This is where His next blessing comes in!</p>\n\n<p>Deuteronomy 33:3-4 Yea, he loved the people; all his saints [are] in thy hand: and they sat down at thy feet; [every one] shall receive of thy words. Moses commanded us <strong>a law</strong>, [even] <strong>the inheritance of the congregation of Jacob</strong>.</p>\n\n<p>So, what is one of the many reasons the Sabbath is so important? Because it brings us into closer union with the Lord. As Isaiah 58:13-14 explains, in it:</p>\n\n<p>we will not do our own ways -- but the Lord's ways\nwe will not seek our own pleasures - but the Lord's pleasures,\nwe will not speak our own words -- but the Lord's words</p>\n\n<p>Then...\nWe will delight, [more and more] in the Lord\nWe will meet with Him in communion on His holy day\nWe will be given more insight from Torah (the heritage of Jacob)!</p>\n\n<p>A lifetime of Sabbaths afford the non-scholar the opportunity to spend 16 uninterrupted, waking hours a week of time with the Lord and His word, leading to understanding and knowing the Lord and filling your life with the delight of His word. </p>\n\n<p>Thus saith the LORD, Let not the wise [man] glory in his wisdom, neither let the mighty [man] glory in his might, let not the rich [man] glory in his riches: But let him that glorieth glory in this, <strong>that he understandeth and knoweth me</strong>, that I [am] the LORD which exercise lovingkindness, judgment, and righteousness, in the earth: <strong>for in these [things] I delight</strong>, saith the LORD. - Jeremiah 9:23-24 KJV</p>\n\n<p>But his <strong>delight</strong> [is] in the law of the LORD; and in his law doth he meditate day and night. - Psalm 1:2 KJV</p>\n\n<p>I <strong>delight</strong> to do thy will, O my God: yea, thy law [is] within my heart. - Psalm 40:8</p>\n\n<p>In the multitude of my thoughts within me thy comforts <strong>delight</strong> my soul. - Psalm 94:19</p>\n\n<p>Psalm 119:35, 77, 174 KJV\nMake me to go in the path of thy commandments; for therein do I <strong>delight</strong>.\nLet thy tender mercies come unto me, that I may live: for thy law [is] my <strong>delight</strong>.\nI have longed for thy salvation, O LORD; and thy law [is] my <strong>delight</strong>. - </p>\n\n<p>And <strong>I will give them an heart to know me</strong>, that I [am] the LORD: and they shall be my people, and I will be their God: for they shall return unto me with their whole heart. Jeremiah 24:7</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>R Akiva Tatz has a beautiful explanation on this. He starts by asking why all holidays happen once a year but Shabbat is every week. What is it that we need to be reminded of every week?</p>\n\n<p>He responds that Shabbat is an opportunity to reflect on one's achievements during the week and to check we are indeed directing our lives in the proper way.</p>\n\n<p>Shabbat is called “<em>me’eyn olam ha’ba</em>” – a small degree of the experience of the next world. Just as the one who eats on Shabbat is the one who prepared in advance (see <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Avodah_Zarah.3a.10?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Avoda Zara 3a</a>), the one who enjoys the world to come is the one who prepared in this world. Shabbat breaks the illusion of immortality. There are never more than 7 days before Shabbat reminds us to take stock of where we stand in relation to Torah and mitzvot.</p>\n\n<p>So to answer your question, Shabbat brings blessing because it keeps us focused on what matters and enables us to fully benefit from our rewards in the world to come. As the prophet says in the verse you quote: \"then you shall delight yourself in the Lord\".</p>\n\n<p>R Tatz writes this much more beautifully than I summarized above, see a <a href=\"http://www.jle.org.uk/article.php?id=57&setid=14\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">short version here</a> and a <a href=\"https://www.simpletoremember.com/articles/a/shabbos-shabbat/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">longer version here</a>. There is also a recorded version of a longer shiur on the topic <a href=\"https://overcast.fm/+GRdORI5E\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a>.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>On a more technical level, \"ride high on the hills\" is not a material blessing. <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Isaiah.58.14?lang=bi&p2=Radak_on_Isaiah.58.14.2&lang2=bi&w2=all&lang3=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Radak</a> understand \"the hills\" to mean Eretz Israel \"which is higher than all countries\".</p>\n\n\n",

On the other hand, I find HaMaor to contain: while they too \"clean\" the texts on the page I find their notes to have too many unnecessary \"round ups\" of commentaries at the bottom of each page; formatting of pages feel dizzying (like the Oz VeHadar gemara); compilation at the end of each volume is more for reference type - something I find dispensable, unlike the compilation of Mechon Yerushalayim's Shulchan Aruch.

However, he notes that Teimanim traditionally referred to it in the singular.[i]</p>\n\n<p>It should be noted that this explanation probably does not address nissuin though.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>[i] Lest anyone ask that the tractate is called 'Kiddushin', that is like 'Pesahim', the korban is still called a 'Pesah'. So too, the tractate refers to marriages, but individual ones are referred to as 'kiddush'.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>Kiddush means Havdolo(separation).Rashi says in Bereishis 2,3 on the word וַיְקַדֵּשׁ -קדשו במן שלא ירד כלל בשבת - Hashem separated Shabbos from the rest of the week by not making the manna fall at all on shabbos in contrast to the rest of the week where it did fall. </p>\n\n<p>On shabos You are doing one separation between a Chol weekday, and a Kodesh Shabbos this is indicated in the Brocho where we say Mekadesh Hashabbos (note that Ki vonu bocharto.. micol hoamim is in brackets and some people don't say it for this very reason that we are mainly marking the difference between Shabbos and Chol, other separations are subordinate. This would also explain why in havdala [singular] that even though there are 4 separations, the preeminent separation is between Shabbat and Chol). </p>\n\n<p>This is 1 division</p>\n\n<p>At a kidushin there are numerous divisions, because through marrying a women That man becomes separted (see Vayikra chapter 18 for the list)i.e biblicly forbiden to:<br>\n1. her mother,<br>\n2.her Mother's mother<br>\n3.her Father's Mother<br>\n4.her daughter(s)<br>\n5.her Son's daughter(s)<br>\n6.her daughters daughter(s)<br>\n7. Her sister(s)<br>\n8. He's Rabbinically forbidden to the Bride until she enters his domicile (i.e chuppa).</p>\n\n<p>She is also forbiddon to everyone in the world like Hekdesh.</p>\n\n<p>So we see 9 different separations: 8 on the mans side and 1 separation to an entity(which includes all men including the husband who is rabbically forbidden to her until she enters his domicile) on the womans side.</p>\n\n<p>This is indicated in the Brocho (kesubos 7b) ברכת האירוסין מאי מברך רבין בר רב אדא ורבה בר רב אדא תרוייהו משמיה דרב יהודה אמרי בא\"י אמ\"ה אשר קדשנו במצותיו וצונו <strong>על העריות ואסר לנו את הארוסות</strong> והתיר לנו את הנשואות על ידי חופה \nוקדושין - Arayos are new forbidddon relationships that are biblically forbiddon,  arusos are the man and woman who are rabbically forbiddon to each other until she enters his domicile.</p>\n\n<p>\"האיש מקדש\" is singular because he is only one man (we're not dealing with many men betrothing simultaniously). But he can sanctify (separate) many things at once e.g  האיש מקדש את אשתו ואת עצמו מן אמה אם אביה בתה בת בתה</p>\n\n<p>Eirusin is plural because it means 2 things are happening the husband is betrothed to the woman and the woman is betrothed to the man, result being they are both ossur to each other as it says ואסר לנו את הארוסות.</p>\n\n<p>Nissuin is plural because it means 2 things are happening the husband is permitted (i.e the prohibition is lifted of himself) to the woman and the woman is permitted to the man, result being they are both permitted to each other. Nissuin litterally means lifting off oneself (the prohibition of being together from the time of betrothal) as it says famously in Tashlich from micha 7,19 מִי אֵל כָּמוֹךָ נֹשֵׂא עָו‍ֹן - Who is G-d like You who lifts off sin from upon us.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Is someone required to ask forgiveness if he causes tangential discomfort to another?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>My son relayed this to me a few days ago.</p>\n\n<p>When he was in yeshiva high school, the principal would enter each classes a few days before Yom Kippur and tell all the students that he was sorry if he may have hurt someone's feelings.</p>\n\n<p>My son, asked me (he's graduated the yeshiva several years ago) that in hindsight, he thought that this was an ingenuous apology because most of the time he was enforcing yeshiva rules that my son didn't like, and he (my son) knew that he would be doing the same thing next year, anyway.</p>\n\n<p>After telling me this story, I wondered, myself that there are numerous times throughout the year when I am in a similar situation as a father. I have to enforce curfews and certain rules in my home. My kids are assigned certain chores during the week. If they don't do it, or I find they're lazy, etc. I \"rebuke\" them and sometimes punish them. If I didn't enforce these rules, I'd be a negligent parent and I would have an unruly child. My child's feelings are sometimes hurt when I enforce these rules.</p>\n\n<p>So, did I sin by merely causing someone else's discomfort, tangentially? I didn't intentionally try to harm his feelings, because enforcing a policy applies to everyone, equally. It's that the person resents following the policy, and then is offended when I have to penalize that person for not following it. Do I still need to apologize for this?</p>\n\n<p>Part of the teshuva is that I don't repeat the same action. I know already that I would continue following enforcing the same policy in the future. So, wouldn't apologizing be pointless and be insincere, in such a case? It would almost be like lying or creating a false impression. </p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>If it helps readers understand an analogy - It's like when politicians offend someone and afterwards say \"I'm sorry that you were offended by what I said.\" That's not at all the same as saying, \"I'm sorry that I offended you by what I said.\" </p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>My rav explained that a person does not need to apologize for enforcing rules or punishing someone for not obeying the rules. He does need to apologize if he exceeded the parameters in some way, such as:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Explaining the rules (orally or even in writing) <strong>unnecessarily</strong> harshly so that it hurt someone's feelings. (For example, using \"severe\" or \"threatening\" language when it is unnecessary.) </li>\n<li>Punishing the person harshly, beyond what was necessary. Ideally, the punishment should be explained clearly at the time that the rules are explained</li>\n<li>Not enforcing or obeying the rules, equally. For example, if he ignores some violators but punishes others.</li>\n<li>The rabbi wasn't sure if he needs to apologize if he did not verify that the person receiving the punishment knew and understood the rules. (I.e., is ignorance excusable?) The best way to avoid this doubt is to have the rules and consequences written and make it the responsibility (a rule for reading the rules!!!) of all people to read the rules.  </li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>He agreed with me that assuming no violation of the above, in many cases, the violator actually should be apologizing to the enforcer! The enforcer, of course, may accept the apology, but, nonetheless is <em>required</em> to enforce the penalty, despite the apology! If not, we have the 3rd problem mentioned, above!</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>A parent and a teacher are required to discipline children. In fact if a father or a teacher hit a child to punish them but the blow was so hard that they died they would not be liable to the death penalty! Since as a parent you are required to take part in the upbringing of your children, just because some of the required things may cause discomfort to your children does not mean you must ask their forgiveness! (and furthermore, they are required by the torah to respect you.) </p>\n\n<p>In this case, the principal was not apologizing if he caused pain or discomfort to anyone by enforcing his rules, but rather if he said something mean or ignored someone when he shouldn't of. He was not asking if his rules upset anyone, because that's his job and it is required to raise children. </p>\n\n<p>Causing someone else's discomfort is not necessarily a sin either. for example, if a friend of yours got upset when you ate peaches, you would not be required to absolve yourself of peaches (or ask their forgiveness.). It is only a sin to cause discomfort that you have <b>no right to do</b>. </p>\n\n<p>Since you have a right to parent your children, you are not required to ask their forgiveness if your parenting annoys them, only if you caused them pain that was not really necessary.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Does G-d control all things all the time?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>I want to share some thoughts: \nI believe HaShem can do whatever he wants to, and He can do it whenever He wants to. The entire existence is a creation of G-ds consciousness; everything that can be found in this entire universe has no independent existence outside of HaShem 'willing' it to exist. He is the Creator the Source, Sustainer and Supervisor of all creation. </p>\n\n<p>Scripture shows He can use or steer or control everything which He created. But does this mean that HaShem <em>does</em> always controls everything, or just that HaShem <em>can</em> (in order to fulfill His plan/wil)?</p>\n\n<p>Does every drop of rain falls exactly on the place and at the time which \nG-d chose it to, does every tree produce as much as G-d wants it to, and does every animal which falls and dies because of specific wounds die of those because HaShem had wanted it to happen exactly like this? Is everything that happens in this world happening because HaShem controls it to happen? </p>\n\n<p>I know of - and believe in - the concept of free will, but like humans do animals, nature and such have their own way of freedom? Or does HaShem indeed controls everything, always and all the time (around us)? </p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>You might want to understand the very idea of <strong>causality</strong>, as your question of Hashem's control comes down to it. Causality in its turn is tied to the existence of time, meaning the cause precedes the outcome. In other words, Hashem decides on somethings, then Hashem does something then it gets fulfilled.</p>\n\n<p>This can only be true in our physical reality that is time-bounded and in our \"reality-bounded\" perception. As Hashem \"exists\" beyond the time, our 6000 or 13.8 Bn years are simultaneous to Him. Hence, there's no causality for Hashem (from His standpoint). The reality unfolds before our eyes, mimicking causality, but for Hashem, it is one piece. </p>\n\n<p>Think about <strong>downloading a 2-hour movie: it is one file, but you're unable to see it all at once</strong>, all you can do is to watch it frame by frame, creating an illusion of a plot. It appears to us that every minute the movie can take a different path, but the file is already there. Same with our world - it is one 6K/13B year-long digital movie, that we're enjoying frame by frame. </p>\n\n<p>So to your question \"<em>Does every drop of rain falls exactly on the place and at the time which G-d chose it to <strong>ALL THE TIME</em></strong>?\" the answer is Yes (and No), but <strong>He did it once and for all.</strong></p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>Another point, your question of \"<em>does HaShem indeed controls everything, always and all the time</em>?\" <strong>is an axiom that's taken for granted and not a theorem that needs to be proven</strong>. All the religion(s) is based on that premise and is derived from it, not the vice verse. So there's not much that can be said about this, just to accept it as is.</p>\n\n<p>That's how I see it.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>Only people have free will, which HaShem does not explicitly control. As for nature, well yes and no. HaShem created the world 'bederach hatevah', according to the laws of nature, and thus the world we live in is predictable. But it doesn't have to be this way. Everything that happens is only because HaShem wills it, and like you said, the amount every tree produces, where each raindrop falls, every animal that dies - this is all HaShem's will. In the end, because HaShem is usually following a predictable set of rules, this gives rise to the illusion that only when miracles happen is HaShem interfering. But nothing about this world is explicitly 'natural'. HaShem controls all nature, and hides himself behind derech hatevah, but in the end He is the one pulling the strings.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>On the ultimate level nothing exists except Hashem Who is undivided, simple, true. Pure actuality with no potentiality.\nA goodhearted person feasts perpetually on the Presence of Hashem always with us. \nHashem runs everything, creates everything, no man's will or nature runs things.</p>\n\n<p>As the ultimate emes is Hashem, ein od milvado, the ultimate sheker is aetheism.</p>\n\n\n",

Are these requests in any way effective when it comes to doing <em>teshuva</em>?  It seems that according to Yoma 87 and the Rambam (somewhere), we need to acknowledge the transgression and make amends, which is hard to do without knowing what it is and whom you wronged.  On the other hand, respected, knowledgable people like rabbis and teachers in yeshiva do this, so they presumably know something I don't.</p>\n\n<p>(When I've been in this position I usually instead say \"if I have hurt you, please bring it to my attention so I can make amends\", which would seem to solve the problem.  But maybe I'm solving a problem I don't need to solve, and by instead making a blanket request I can do <em>teshuva</em> for transgressions that people would be too shy to make me aware of?

    "content": "# God's decision vs being written in the book of life\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>Why do we ask god to inscribe us in he book of life? If whatever god does is for the best including when god removes someone from this world. We even have a custom when we hear that someone passed away we say, \"Baruch Dayan ha'emet\". If we believe that god does everything for the best then who are we to ask him to give us life? The same way he felt it was necessary to give us life he may feel it is necessary to take it away. Even great people and pious people receive \"premature\" death or even a form of  seemingly kareit! If someone can bring a quote from a source of any Jewish text that could answer this question that  would be awesome. </p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>I am combining two main themes.</p>\n\n<p>First, if G-d had already decided our fate, then, what would be the whole purpose of all the prayers that we do, not just on the High Holidays, but each day of the year? Furthermore, what would be the point of teshuva (repentance) at any point in the year?</p>\n\n<p>In actuality, G-d prefers that we repent and not die. G-d doesn't desire the death of even the most wicked person, but would rather have him repent and turn to the ways of G-d. See <a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=14256&st=&pgnum=285\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Yechezkel 33:11</a> for a verse that emphasizes exactly this concept.</p>\n\n<p>Either Art Scroll or Birnbaum siddur explains an interesting phrase that we say in each Amidah during the 10 Days of Repentance:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>זכרינו לחיים... וכתבינו בספר החיים <strong>למענך</strong> א-להים חיים</p>\n  \n  <p>Remember us for life ... and inscribe us in the book of life <strong>for\n  your sake</strong>, living G-d.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>What does \"for your sake\" mean? This is in line with what I stated above. G-d wants man to live because he wants to continuously bless us and do good things for us. But, that's not automatic, as the verse (and you) have implied. Wicked people who don't repent and continuously defy the commandments do deserve to be punished. How do we know, ourselves, what G-d's \"limit of tolerance\" is, and is it the same standard for everyone?</p>\n\n<p>Thus, we repent and also ask G-d to sustain us so that we can continue to please G-d when we perform mitzvoth and follow his ways.</p>\n\n\n",

While the nightly volume is nowhere as busy as it is on Erev Yom Kippur, I am concerned about the general hygiene in mikva'ot for some of my friends and relatives. Some women have told me some \"horror\" stories about things that they've seen in the mikvah that really churn my stomach.</p>\n\n<p>In a small town that has 1 or 2 mikva'ot, there's little choice of where women can go. But in a large city where there are numerous mikva'ot, I wonder if anyone has published a \"rating\" or evaluation of the health safety and appearance of mikva'ot. I would gather that the city or state health department inspects these places, also, no? If they do, I think they publish any findings. </p>\n\n<p>As I told a M.Y.'er in a recent comment, if I were a different gender, perhaps, I would evaluate and publish my own rating in my own area, at least.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>I guess I shouldn't be surprised that just about everything is on the web except the fear of heaven.</p>\n\n<p>While looking up the hours for my local mikvah, I found <a href=\"http://www.mikvah.org/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">mikvah.org</a>.

It that his שיטה למעשה?</p>\n  \n  <p>Thank you.</p>\n  \n  <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p>\n  \n  <p>The Rav’s intent there is that it does not involve the melacha of\n  מחתך. However there would still bea problem of קורע. In the above\n  tshuva, there is no קורע issue as the tearing is totally destructive.\n  However with toilet paper the tearing creates a useful item which is\n  prohibited. There is a dispute in the Rishonim if this korea, which is\n  productive but not to prepare for sewing, is a Rabbinic or Biblical\n  prohibition.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.shemayisrael.com/parsha/ostroff/archives/shabbos3_13.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rabbi Ostroff</a> discusses the matter.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><em>What about tearing toilet paper when there is no option?</em></p>\n  \n  <p>Obviously one must prepare toilet paper before Shabbos. The problem\n  arises when one has depleted the supply of tissues, torn toilet paper\n  etc. or one is in a place where there is no pre-torn paper.</p>\n  \n  <p>For obvious reasons we will not discuss the various technical options\n  that are on hand when there is no toilet paper available, but when\n  those options are exhausted and/or one’s only practical option is\n  uncut toilet paper, the following is the correct procedure:</p>\n  \n  <p>One should tear the toilet paper by resting one’s elbows on the sheet\n  of toilet paper and tear it with one’s elbows. This is called tearing\n  kilachar yad – in a backhanded manner, and is only an issur d’rabanan.\n  [6]</p>\n  \n  <p><em>Where do we find that one may violate an issur d’rabanan in such a case?</em></p>\n  \n  <p>There are two sources. The Rama says [7] that one may carry stones\n  (olden day toilet paper) from a reshus hayachid (a private domain)\n  into a karmelis even though one is violating an issur d’rabanan. The\n  basis for this heter is that Chazal did not institute their\n  prohibition when it confronts a person’s dignity - 'kavod habriyus'.</p>\n  \n  <p>The other source is the Mechaber [8] who permits one to raise a stone\n  that has moss growing on it even though raising it from the ground is\n  a violation of an issur d’rabanan.</p>\n  \n  <p>This therefore is the basis for this heter.</p>\n  \n  <p><em>Does it make a difference whether toilet paper is torn on the dotted line?</em></p>\n  \n  <p>In order to answer this question we must, in a few words, familiarize\n  ourselves with the melacha called Mechatech – tearing or cutting to an\n  exact size or measurement.</p>\n  \n  <p>'Mechatech' is the melacha of cutting or tearing an item for a\n  specific purpose or size. An example of this is a gemora which says\n  that one who purposely breaks the feather between the soft part and\n  hard part has violated Mechatech. The soft part would be used for down\n  and pillows and the hard part would be used for hat manufacturing.\n  Since one is particular about breaking the feather at that exact\n  point, it is mechatech.</p>\n  \n  <p>Based on this and many other proofs we can determine that although\n  tearing toilet paper involves Kore’ah and maybe even “making a k’li”,\n  tearing on the dotted line is probably not Mechatech. Rav Shlomo\n  Zalman Auerbach explains [9] that since one only tears on the dotted\n  line because it is a convenient manner of tearing the paper but not\n  because one is particular about the exact size of the paper. Proof of\n  that is that each paper company has a different size paper and nobody\n  buys paper because company A has paper size B.</p>\n  \n  <p>This means that one may only tear paper backhandedly, as mentioned\n  above, when there is no other feasible option, but one need not be\n  particular about not cutting on the perforated line.</p>\n  \n  <p>However, we do not find this opinion mentioned in other poskim and\n  therefore, if possible, one should avoid tearing on the perforated\n  line.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

The central belief in Judaism is that every Jew has a pure nature at their core. We are all inherently good people who simply fall from the divine path we were meant to walk. Teshuvah implies that a person is returning to this natural state rather than destroying their past mistakes and starting anew. This is a different philosophy from <strong>Charatah</strong>.</p></li>\n<li><p><strong>Charatah</strong> is remorse for the past and an intention to start anew. This idea runs in contrast to Teshuvah in that you intend to completely reinvent yourself rather than return to an original nature.

Why is it that <em>HaShem</em> (Who first declareren to Avram to leave his country, kindred, father's house, and go to the land which <em>HaShem</em> will show him - to go to) declares to Avraham: 'to become a nation' and 'in thee shall all be blessed'?</p>\n<p>Why was it neccessary to become a nation and a blessing? What's the impotance behind it?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>In his commentary on <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Genesis.12.2-3\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Genesis 12:2-3</a> (and elsewhere, if I'm not mistaken, R' Samson Raphael Hirsch speaks of Avraham's descendants' duty to be a \"model nation.\" Where other nations default to striving to be \"blessed\" (i.e. preserving national prosperity) the Israelites are required to show what it means to strive to \"be a blessing.\" \"To dedicate themselves with all devotion to the Divine purpose of bringing happiness to the world and mankind, thereby as models ...\"</p>\n\n<p>R' Hirsch says that this ideal nationhood of \"be a blessing\" is meant to be attained in the Land of Israel, where the Israelite nation can exist as an independent model. The second verse, \"And I will bless those that bless you ...\", refers to Israel's existence in exile, dependent on host nations. In this sub-ideal state, the Israelite nation has a different model of influencing the world for the better, through God's like-for-like reaction to those who choose to help the Israelites in their mission (\"bless you\") and to those who choose the opposite.</p>\n\n\n",

But it should not be so. Rather, when a person is born, people should not rejoice over him, for they do not know which challenging situations and actions he will have to stand up to, whether he will be a Tzadik or a Rasha, whether good or evil. But when he dies, then they should rejoice, for it is then that they can see that he has departed from the world with a good name and he has left the world in peace. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The Midrash illustrates with a parable: people rejoice over a ship leaving the harbor but not over one entering. It really should be the other way around - the one leaving could get hit by storms, winds, and hurricanes, while the one entering should be rejoiced upon for its successful arrival. </p>\n\n<p>In practice, though, this isn’t the case. Although it’s certainly natural for one to rejoice over a newborn and for one to mourn over the loss of a close one, why do we not find any Halacha that dictates that we should do the opposite?</p>\n\n<p>(It should be pointed out that one reason given for Lag BaOmer is celebrating R’ Shimon bar Yochai’s life - not mourning his death.

You created it, You\nformed it, You breathed it into me ...\":  Teshuvah, literally\ntranslated means “return.” We believe that the soul is intrinsically\npure and began  its sojourn in this world in a state of purity.\nMistakes and wrongdoings are departures from the  essential nature of\nthe human soul. Therefore when a person has done something wrong, the\nprocess  of teshuvah is really that of going back to his or her true\nessence.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>So Teshuvah doesn't only mean to return to HaShem and His Torah, but it also means to return, to return to the original state (its pristine core; to one's original nature) we were in.</p>\n<p>But how does one achieve this?

Divine compassion is also to be aroused for the source of the\nsoul in the source of life, the Name of G‑d, the Tetragrammaton. \"He\nshall return to G‑d and He will grant him mercy.\" \"Him\" would refer to\nG‑d here, arousing mercies on the life-giving power issuing from His\nName, that has descended into the chambers of the impure sitra achra,\nto give them vitality. This was brought about through the deeds of\nman, his scheming and evil thoughts.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The second step is:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The second element is <strong>to crush and subdue evil, the husk and sitra\nachra</strong>, whose entire being is simply grossness and arrogance. \"If you\nexalt yourself like the eagle...\" This crushing and subjugation is to\nbe literally into the ground, for this is its death and nullification.\nEvil is crushed through a broken and shattered heart, a sense of\npersonal unworthiness, repugnance ...</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>How is the second step done?</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>But the true humbling of the heart, that it be broken and crushed, and the removal of the spirit of impurity and sitra achra, is achieved through being a \"master of accounting\" with all the profundity of the mind. He must concentrate his intellect and understanding deeply for a period every day, or at night before Tikun Chatzot, to realise that through his sins he wrought the exile of the Shechinah, as noted above. <strong>He will also ponder that he [caused] the uprooting of his spirit and divine soul from the true Life, and demeaned it to a place of defilement and death</strong>, the chambers of the sitra achra. He must become deeply aware that his soul has become a vehicle for them, receiving from them vitality to endow his body, as noted above.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>In <a href=\"https://www.chabad.org/library/tanya/tanya_cdo/aid/1029244/jewish/Chapter-8.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Chapter 8 of Igeret HaTeshuva</a>, the Alter Rebbe discusses what happens when the \"cleansing spirit passes over and purifies a person\":</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>As there is a \"restoration\" of the hai above, so too below in the divine soul within man, no more do \"your sins divide.\" It is said, \"He cleanses\"— those who come back to Him, to lave and cleanse their souls of the soiled garments, the \"externals\" that the Talmud describes as \"encrusting ...\"</p>\n<p>After the cleansing spirit passes over and purifies them, then their\nsouls are enabled to return unto G‑d Himself, literally, to ascend the\ngreatest heights, to their very source, and cleave to Him with a\nremarkable unity. This is the original unity, the ultimate in union,\nthat existed before the soul was blown by the breath of His mouth to\ndescend and be incorporated within the body of man. (To illustrate\nthis unity: before one exhales, the breath is united with the person;\nhe and his breath are not separable yet.) This is the perfect return,\nteshuvah. This state of unity and this return are called teshuvah\nila'a, the superior return, that follows teshuvah tata'a, the inferior\nreturn. The Zohar, in Raya Mehemna on Nasso, explains that teshuvah\nilaa is being occupied with Torah study, in reverence and fear of the\nHoly One ... for this is ben yud-hai or binah ... (Here the\nsuperiority of the penitent over the perfectly saintly, as the Zohar\nstates in Chayei Sara, is that \"They draw onto themselves with a more\nintense longing of the heart, and with greater forcefulness, to\napproach the King...\")</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>But how does one achieve this?

Some points from there:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\"Teshuvah\" is the letters \"Shabat - Hei.\" Through the Shabbat rest he can honestly see himself and make Teshuvah.</li>\n<li>When can a person see his lowliness? On Shabbat, as it says (Ex. 16), \"See, for H' gave you HSBT/the Shabbat\" [= letters Teshuvah].</li>\n<li>And Shabat is the letters Shin(=3) BaT - the three colors of the eye and the Bat/pupil - by Shabbat, one sees all the levels entirely: above him, below, and what he is.</li>\n<li>Who attained this?

Now, each person must see to it to not hold up the Redemption.</li>\n<li>Shabat and <strong>Teshuvah Sheleima</strong> are interdependent, as ShaBaT/ShaBTa is the same spelling (Deut. 30): \"W'ShBTa ad ([W - the aspect of the Tzaddik/Moshe, as is brought] - and you shall return - all the way up to) H' your God.\"</li>\n</ul>\n<blockquote>\n<p>And how does this helps a person not to do a sin anymore in the future; wasn't it from this state of being that one sinned in the first place?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Of course it will help. However it may not prevent sin entirely.\nEven a complete Tzaddik can make a mistake. Moshe Rabbeinu himself erred in striking the rock.

You need to call a group that is recognized by everyone else such as the <a href=\"http://www.rabbis.org/conversion.cfm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rabbinical Council of America</a> whose <a href=\"http://www.rabbis.org/pdfs/GPSprotocol.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">explanation</a> should make things clearer to you.</p>\n\n<p>Note that the <em>Rabbi</em> and <em>Bais Din</em> that you used <strong>sound</strong> as if they would not meet the requirements for certification shown in the site that I referenced above. Of course, since I do not know who they are, I cannot say for certain what is going on.</p>\n\n<p>It is possible, that they determined that the person is actually Jewish (son or daughter of a Jewish mother) but <strong>may</strong> be doing this to ensure that the person is recognized as Jewish. If that is the case, then the mikvah is not required for <em>conversion</em></p>\n\n<p>In order to ensure that the <em>bais din</em> that you are using is indeed legitimate, you should call the <a href=\"http://www.rabbis.org/contact_us.cfm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rabbinical Council of America</a></p>\n\n<p>305 Seventh Avenue, 12th Floor<br>\nNew York, New York 10001<br>\nPhone 1: 212-807-9000<br>\nPhone 2: 212-741-7522<br>\nFax: 212-727-8452  </p>\n\n<p>To contact the Rabbinical Council of America by email office@rabbis.org </p>\n\n<p>Rabbi Mark Dratch, Executive Vice President mdratch@rabbis.org<br>\nRabbi Elazar Muskin, President President@rabbis.org</p>\n\n<p>I hope that you will be able to get an accepted conversion certificate or at least a referral to a legitimate Rabbi for advice.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>I assumed this question was theoretical until I saw the conversation with Sabbahillel. By the sound of it, it seems like you underwent a Reform conversion - maybe a Conservative one, but I haven't heard of any Conservative conversions that don't use a mikvah. </p>\n\n<p>Either way, your question does seem to touch on some theoretical discussions in conversion law, so there are answers to your questions. Firstly, a conversion can be done in a natural body of water just like a mikvah. The mikvah is meant to substitute for natural water, not vice versa, after all. However, simply going there yourself is not sufficient. There is discussion of this case in the Talmud, or at least in a prominent side commentary to it. The conclusion is that an immersion with no witnesses is pointless. To play on a common allegory, if a tree falls in the forest and no one is there to hear it, it <em>doesn't</em> make a sound.</p>\n\n<p>When you say \"public conversion ceremony,\" that reminds me of something akin to confirmation events that some Reform congregations hold for new converts, which is what is making me think you did this process with a Reform congregation. Those ceremonies, however positive they might be and innocent, are actually meaningless as a means of bringing someone into the Jewish people/Judaism.</p>\n\n<p>The mikvah/natural water immersion is essential. For males, circumcision is essential (unless you were born without a foreskin, which is a theoretical case discussed in ancient sources - I forget where). When the Temple is standing, you must bring a sacrifice, but we do not consider that third requirement to inhibit the conversion process. The sacrifice is not required for a conversion to come into effect and isn't really relevant to this discussion (I thought it was important to mention it anyway since all major Jewish legal sources equate the three requirements in terms of importance).</p>\n\n<p>As Sabbahillel said, you should contact an Orthodox Rabbi. I would recommend trying to contact a specific conversion-related Rabbinical body, but that is in addition to contacting the nearest Orthodox Rabbi possible regardless of that Rabbi's connections with conversion courts. While the standards the RCA use to weigh the validity of a conversion are probably stricter than required by Jewish law especially with the policy changes of the last 10 years with the GPS, the RCA is the most respected authority in the US and Canada for recognizing conversions. They are definitely more respected than the Israeli Rabbinate, which many mainstream Rabbis in North America consider to excessively and unjustifiably strict.</p>\n\n\n",

Some people say Birchas HaTorah as soon as they awake and prior to saying these Pesukim. However there are those that come to Shul and put on the Talis and then say the Pesukim listed for after put on the Talis and the same for Tefilin. There are those who then say Kadesh and V'hoyo Ki Yeviacha and then Ma Tovu and Adon Olam prior to saying Birchas HaTorah. I am looking for a source and perhaps a reason explaining why it is not a problem to say these Pesukim prior to Birchas HaTorah. </p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 5)\n\n<p>The Tur (OC 46) had the same issue as you. He writes that the custom around him was to say Birkot haTorah and some Torah content before Pesukei deZimra but after reciting the \"Leolam Yehei\" and \"Attah Hu\" prayers which themselves contain Torah content including verses. Accordingly he changed his own practice to say Birkot haTorah immediately after Elohai Neshama at the very beginning of the day.</p>\n\n<p>However, other Rishonim (such as Agur (92)) do not have a problem with this set up because the verses are being recited דרך תחנונים by way of supplication, not דרך לימוד by way of learning. Indeed, by the fact that the Tur thought to change it, we see longstanding custom was in accordance with this view. The Gra records in his commentary to the below-cited Shulchan Aruch that in all the very old Siddurim or records of the order of prayer he could find, he saw that all of them place Birkot haTorah later.</p>\n\n<p>The Shuchan Aruch (OC 46:9) rules:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>לא יקרא פסוקים קודם ברכת התורה, אעפ\"י שהוא אומרם דרך תחנונים. ויש אומרים שאין לחוש, כיון שאינו אומרם אלא דרך תחנונים, ונכון לחוש לסברא ראשונה. <em>הגה:  אבל המנהג כסברה אחרונה שהרי בימי הסליחות מתפללים הסליחות ואחר כך מברכין על התורה עם סדר שאר הברכות וכן בכל יום כשנכנסין לבית הכנסת אומרים כמה פסוקים ותחנונים ואחר כך מברכין על התורה</em><br>\n  One should not read verses before reciting Birkot haTorah, even though they are being said by way of supplication. And some say one should not worry about this because they are only said by way of supplication. And it is proper to worry about the first opinion. <em>Gloss: But the custom is like the latter opinion, for on the days of Selichot we pray the Selichot and afterwards bless on the Torah with the rest of the blessings, and so too every day when we enter the synagague we say various verses and supplications and then bless on the Torah.</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>So it seems there is strong traditional basis to not worry about saying verses by way of supplication before reciting Birkot haTorah.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# May Jews not pray to the Abrahamic God in any guise?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>I came across this comment on another site of the Stack Exchange network posted on a question discussing whether it is OK for someone who is not a Christian to be participate in a Christian prayer (saying grace):</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>I'm Jewish in the Christian-dominated US, and even though I'm not deep in the bible belt I run into \"of course you are; isn't everybody?\" presumption quite a bit. As a Jew I am forbidden to participate in prayers to anybody other than our God, and that poses difficulties sometimes. Your advice to just step back if standing or silently shake your head to the people on either side if sitting is what I do. (If I can avoid being at the table I do that.) That works for me, and I find that nobody takes note of my failure to say \"amen\" (or any part of the prayer), either.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>My (admittedly limited) understanding of the relationship between Christianity, Judaism and Islam is that the three worship the same God. Each approaches their relationship to God differently, but the God is the same. Wouldn't it therefore be permitted for a Jew to participate in a Christian prayer as long as that were directed to God and not to Jesus Christ? </p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 16)\n\n<p>Christianity and Islam say they worship the same god that we do, but that does not make it so.</p>\n\n<p>Christianity is the bigger problem.  They say that a human being was part of God, <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/a/134/472\">which is <em>shituf</em></a> (think of it as heresy).  That means it is forbidden for a Jew to participate in their prayers.  On top of that, the trinity concept adds confusion.  I am aware that different Christian denominations give the trinity greater or lesser importance.  Distinguishing all the nuances calls for more expertise in Christianity than most of us have.</p>\n\n<p>Islam is less problematic, in that they don't say that God took human form, but they do sanctify the Christian gospels, counting Jesus as a prophet.  Like Christianity, they say that the torah was deprecated or superseded, so they are at least <em>wrong</em> about God, who gave us an eternal <em>torah</em>, as far as we're concerned.  Whether that is enough for <em>halacha</em> I do not know, but it is enough for (dis)comfort for many, including the author of the comment you quoted.  Some are also concerned about giving the appearance of endorsing another religion.</p>\n\n<p>Even if you think the text of any particular prayer is unobjectionable, carefully reviewing the text (if you can even get it in advance) imposes a burden of both effort and knowledge that many aren't willing to take on.  Especially in a social setting where it's relatively easy to extract oneself, it makes a great deal of sense to do so instead of trying to navigate what is or isn't acceptable.</p>\n\n<p>Besides, in my experience Christians tend to extemporize their prayers, and it's very, very difficult for them to leave Jesus out of it.  So your qualifier of \"as long as they pray to God and not Jesus\", even aside from the other issues I raised, might not stick in the moment.  Rarely-needed care almost never wins out against deeply-ingrained reflex, and the phrase \"through so-and-so our Lord (sic)\" is a standard phrase in Christian prayer.</p>\n\n\n",

The idea that we might have nutritional, taste or other benefit from the palate-cleanser, even if its primary purpose is to fulfill a\n  halacha. (And even then--I've never heard of not making a bracha on\n  something consumed to fulfill a halacha.)\n  7. Wine/alcohol and bread, in particular, are sometimes deemed \"important enough to get a bracha\" in various situations.

Where does he get 1:960 as the magical number to be nullified? (It looks like the Boaz addresses this, but I can’t understand what he’s saying.)</p>\n\n<p>Likewise, according to R’ Yehudah and R’ Yose (<em>especially</em> R’ Yose): why do they not require 1:60?</p>\n\n<p>This question may be strengthened by the Yachin’s final note on the Mishnah, that we indeed pasken 1:60 in this case, against all of these Tannaim (based on YD 3).</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>A berya, a whole being, is not bateil beshishim. (Nullified in a 1:60 r maybe 1/60 mixture. There is a dispute whether we mean 1 part problematic item vs 60 parts of other, or 1/60 of the total mix, which would be 1 part vs 59 parts of other.) What we actually hold in practice for bitul of a berya is more complicated, with opinions ranging from there never is bitul (Shulchan Arukh YD 100:1) to Issur veHeter haArukh (quoted by the Taz ad loc) saying once the berya is lost in the mixture, it's no longer a berya and the usual 1:60 applies. The Gra gives two possibilities -- 1:960 and the Rambam's 1:1000.</p>\n\n<p>The Rosh (on Terumos 10:5, our 10:8) says that this is why bitul beshishim doesn't work in the case you ask about, and you instead need the greater ratio.</p>\n\n<p>A more popular opinion is to focus on the fact that we're talking about tzir, brine, rather than the whole fish. This is the tack taken by Rambam and the Bartenura. Eg, the Bach quotes a mishnah's \"ad shishah asar -- until 16\" as saying  brine's taste is 16 times stronger than most tastes, which is why the gemara requires 1:960 -- 16 times as much as 1:60.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>As for why 960... The mishnah works with established units of measure, not a ratio; 10 Judean zuz or 5 Galilean sela per 2 se'ah container. The Bartenura ad loc says it's simply close enough to the 1:1000 we find elsewhere to be sure there is no ta'am (roughly: taste; more like an expectation of taste, but it's a hard-to-define concept related to taste, perception and psychology).</p>\n\n<p>But this is only the first opinion. Ralbach (in the Frankel Rambam on Maakhalos Asuros 15:34) says the other opinions map to Rabbi Yehudah requiring 1:192 and Rabbi Yosi -- 1:16 (!). Rabbi Yosi's opinion is less startling if you compare to finding a non-kosher cricket in your cricket pickling barrel, where you just pick out the non-kosher one and move on. Halakhah (see the Rambam ad loc) follows the Yerushalmi on our mishnah, requiring 1:200. </p>\n\n\n",

They weren't obligated in circumcision, and thus circumcision wouldn't do anything for them, spiritually. Circumcision is not a component of repentance. (Well, except for a Jew who was obligated and has so far opted not to do it.) The citizens of Ninveh instead accomplish repentance following the time-honored formula: by giving back everything they had stolen, asking forgiveness of their victims, and then confessing, regretting, and committing to God to do better.</p>\n\n<p>(See for instance <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=920&st=&pgnum=210\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Igros Moshe OC4:116</a>, where Rabbi Feinstein states forcefully that inflicting physical pain on oneself is not part of the formula for repentance.)</p>\n\n<p>The Midrash about Joseph telling the Egyptian populace to get circumcised says nothing about having them repent. (Repent from what? The verses there don't [yet] blame the Egyptians for anything; whereas the Ninveh-ites, like the generation of the flood, are explicitly guilty of <em>chamas</em> -- strong-armed theft.) The easiest way to read that Midrash is that Joseph is thinking ahead, trying to prevent the Egyptians from labeling the Jews as \"inferior others\"; if they are all circumcised, it's harder to make that case.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>The Kli Yakar on that verse in Bereishit says that Yosef's action was done for a reason irrelevant to the people in Ninveh. According to the Kli Yakar (I'm summarizing from the text I found on <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Genesis.41.55?lang=bi&p2=Kli_Yakar_on_Genesis.41.55.1&lang2=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">sefaria</a>.org), we find in the Torah text that the word for foreskin (orlah) is equated to the word cherpah (shame) and the word for famine (ra'av) is also equated with the word cherpah (in Ezekiel, 36:30). Therefore, one can remove the cherpah (famine) by removing the cherpah (foreskin) (in his words, \"חשב שבהסרת חרפת הערלה יוסר מהם חרפת הרעב\")</p>\n\n<p>Since the issue with Ninveh was not related to famine, it would not have been relevant to make circumcision part of the process of repentance.</p>\n\n<p>A second answer he gives relates to the specific bad behavior of the Egyptians in terms of their sexual practices, tying their famine to their immorality, so the removal of foreskin was a form of repentance specific to the sin which brought about the lack of food. As that is not relevant to the situation in Ninveh, the circumcision would not have been a pertinent form of repentance.</p>\n\n\n",

I think the reason that there are maybe a handful of the former type is because the Chassidic masters didn't necessarily have a systematized arrangement of philosophies and possibly didn't even want to focus on such \"scientific\" systems. But the reasons and backdrop for this is somewhat off topic. My point is, much of the Chassidic ideas etc. are gleaned from the classics I mentioned. So to begin with, for one not so familiar with the Chassidic literature I'd suggest a perusal of Aryeh Kaplan's 1) <a href=\"https://moznaim.com/product/the-light-beyond/\" rel=\"noreferrer\">The Light Beyond </a>and 2) <a href=\"https://moznaim.com/product/chasidic-masters/\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Chasidic Masters</a>. Also worthwhile is Louis Jacobs' <a href=\"https://www.abebooks.com/book-search/title/hasidic-thought/author/jacobs-louis/\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Hasidic Thought</a> (as well as his couple entries in the EJ). A good anthology of Chassidic thought on a multitude of topics is Louis Newman's <a href=\"https://www.abebooks.com/9780805200461/Hasidic-Anthology-Tales-Teaching-Hasidim-0805200460/plp\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Hasidic Anthology</a>. </p>\n\n<p>Per Hebrew classics, besides those you already mentioned, I'd name: <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/3723\" rel=\"noreferrer\">דגל מחנה אפרים</a>, <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/14213\" rel=\"noreferrer\">תולדות יעקב יוסף</a>, <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/50006\" rel=\"noreferrer\">קדושת לוי</a>, <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/3134\" rel=\"noreferrer\">פרי הארץ</a>, <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/43891\" rel=\"noreferrer\">מגיד דבריו ליעקב</a>, <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/30802\" rel=\"noreferrer\">עבודת ישרא</a>ל. Although these are Torah collections, much Chassidic thought and doctrines are culled from different lessons given over by their respective authors. The בני יששכר is more kabbalistic bent although is also a classic. Then of course the later on in generations you go the more books were published and the more volumes were inducted into the \"Hall of Fame\", e.g. <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/19050\" rel=\"noreferrer\">ערבי נחל</a>, <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/14836\" rel=\"noreferrer\">אוהב ישראל</a> <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/43327\" rel=\"noreferrer\">מאור עיניים</a> etc.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 3)\n\n<p><em>Keser Shem Tov</em> and <em>Tzavaas HaRivash</em>, along with <em>Toldos Yaakov Yosef</em> and <em>Degel Machane Efraim</em> are perhaps the earliest works that one can use to get a sense of the Baal Shem Tov's  teachings. As the BeShT left no written legacy, his earliest students compiled his teachings into a number of <em>sefarim</em>.</p>\n\n<p>As you get further down the chain of transmission you see divergences among the various chassidic schools of thought that resulted from the branching out of different tzaddikim and their students into the other areas of Europe; while the fundamentals still hold true, particular systems will emphasize different aspects of the path of the Baal Shem Tov, informed in part by their own areas of expertise as well as the demographic they were catering to/encountering in their milieu.</p>\n\n<p>A fairly recent listing of what can be boiled down to the ten basic points of the Baal Shem Tov's path can be found as a stand-alone essay in the Divrei Shmuel of Slonim's eponymous <em>sefer</em> (I can't upload the page at the moment).</p>\n\n<p>More recently, Belz has been putting out a series of <em>sefarim</em> that takes an in depth (yet accessible) look at chassidus as a conceptual framework entitled <em>Mesilos b'Ohr HaChassidus</em>.</p>\n\n<p>Good luck!</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>I'm surprised no one has yet mentioned <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Kedushat_Levi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><em>Kedushas Levi</em></a> by <a href=\"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Levi_Yitzchok_of_Berditchev\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rabbi Levi Yitzchok of Berditchev.</a></p>\n\n\n",

And also, thank you for all of your answers, I greatly appreciate it.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 9)\n\n<p>Just like the trope, the tunes are traditional, and yes, each community has its own tunes and even its own system of chanting.  A chazan (cantor) also has significant leeway in choosing tunes.  Since the text is set but the tune is not, the chazan can simply compose a new tune or adapt someone else's tune.  There are halachot regarding this, but not everyone observes them.  Generally, there will be a specific mode (called nusach for Ashkenazim) for chanting prose text, similar to reading from the Tanach, and poetic text may be set to an actual melody.</p>\n\n<p>The way Ashkenazic nusach works is that there are some very basic melodic motifs that the chanting should generally use, and the chazan is free to improvise within that framework.  As synagogue services become more lay-led and less often led by professional chazanim, these motifs solidify into melodic snippets that essentially get rearranged.  There are lots and lots and lots of examples at <a href=\"http://offtonic.com/nusach\" rel=\"noreferrer\">offtonic.com/nusach</a>, including melodic snippets, freer mode-based improvisation, and composed melodies.</p>\n\n<p>The Sephardic world is vast when it comes to diversity, and different communities have very different practices.  Spanish and Portuguese communities do essentially the same as Ashkenazic communities; there are some melodic snippets that the chazan rearranges to fit prose text, and there are composed melodies for poetic texts.  Some tunes actually straddle that line; the famous tune for Bendigamos, for example, gets quite stretched over the course of the song!  Moroccan communities tend to add much more embellishment and improvisation while essentially keeping to the same format.  Syrian communities have a much freer approach; there is a specific musical scale (the maqam) used for each service, which depends on the service, the week of the year, etc., and the text is chanted by improvising freely within that scale.  The improvisation tends to follow certain characteristic patterns, but they don't even come close to being melodic snippets.  For poetic texts, they sing some composed melody in the same maqam.  You can listen to examples at <a href=\"http://www.sephardichazzanut.com/\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Sephardic Hazzanut</a>.  Yemenites...  Yemenites do their own thing.  I can't pretend to understand Yemenite chanting.</p>\n\n<p>To answer one of your other questions, generally speaking Biblical quotes (which are all over the liturgy for what should be obvious reasons) are not specially marked by melodies.  There can be exceptions.  At one Yom Kippur service I once attended, the sha\"tz (stands for SHaliach TZibur, the prayer leader) decided to sing the Hashivenu line of Sh'ma Kolenu in Eichah trope.  I've also heard, at Rosh Hashanah services, I heard the musaf paragraphs detailing the day's sacrifices chanted as it was done during maftir, in high holiday Torah trope.  In many Sephardic communities, including Moroccan as well as Spanish and Portuguese, the Kabbalat Shabbat psalms are chanted with T'hilim trope, whether they know it or not!  Also on Friday night, Moroccans (and only they, that I know of) read four lines from Song of Songs right after L'chah Dodi, and those four lines are read with Song of Songs trope.</p>\n\n<p>I hope that answers some of your questions!  <a href=\"http://offtonic.com/nusach\" rel=\"noreferrer\">NusachDB</a> is a pretty great resource for melodies from around the world.  I know the guy who runs it; I sleep next to his wife every night! (:  NusachDB has a subcategory Nusach Resources, which links to over 400 sites (I don't remember my last count, but you can check) with recordings.  You can even find some sheet music (other than my transcriptions, I mean), including the famous German compendium of nusach from the 1870's, Abraham Baer's Baal T'fillah.  These chants and melodies are always a combination of the very old and very traditional, the very new and very traditional, and the simply new.  I hope you can learn some of these melodies; Judaism, globally, is far the richer for having them.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 5)\n\n<p>This is a great \"beginner's\" question! (though, it's for all levels.)</p>\n\n<p>You are correct that the Bible has trope (cantillation) notes. Their main purpose, actually, is for grammar. However, it does indicate the music, as well. There are different \"tune styles\" or \"modes\" for Torah, Haftarah, and special modes for Ecclessiastes, Lamentations, Esther, etc. You can find the musical notation in the back of the Hertz Bible, as one example. There are other places that I'm sure you can find online that have both written music as well as audio files for the cantillation.</p>\n\n<p>There is no \"trope\" notation for prayers. Instead, there are \"modes\" called \"nusach\", in Hebrew. The nusach dictates the musical \"mood\" and \"style\" that the cantor would use in the synagogue. The cantor, technically, is the congregations \"representative\". While, technically, it is fine if the cantor simply recited the prayers in a monotone, the musical quality absolutely adds much to the prayers and gets the congregation in a better mood and frame of mind to appreciate the prayers. (Imagine going to a lecture where the speaker spoke in a monotone for 4 hours. You would cry from boredom!)</p>\n\n<p>There are different nuscha'ot (pl. of \"nusach\") for weekday, vs. Shabbat and the various holiday prayers. Even various parts of the prayers service during one day also have their own nusach. High Holidays have their own special nusach that generally convey the solemnity of the day. These nuscha'ot have been established standards for a few centuries. You can find some audio files online where you can hear various cantors singing various parts of the prayers. I'll see if I can edit in a source or two.</p>\n\n<p>During the late 1800's into the mid 1900's, there was a huge emphasis in producing professional cantors in Europe as well as the U.S. You can probably locate recordings of some of the greats like Kussevetsky, Mosher Osher, Cantor Rosenblatt and Richard Tucker online. While they all stick to Nusach (for example, the tune for <em>Kol Nidre</em> is pretty much standard for everyone), they also developed their own tunes for certain prayers.</p>\n\n<p>Lastly, there are various \"standard\" congregational tunes sung by almost everyone the same way such as <em>En Kelokeinu</em> (I understand this originated form a church tune) and <em>Aleinu</em> (I have no idea who designed that.)</p>\n\n<p>Besides learning these tunes online, I think the best way is just to attend services regularly. I learned most of the High Holiday tunes (I lead part of the service, now, in my shul) from the chazzan in the shul I grew up in. The majority of his tunes were so unique and so beautiful, that hardly anyone else has even heard of them. I managed to get one impromptu recording of his doing these tunes. But, seriously, regular attendance, paying attention and much repetition, I think is the best way to etch these tunes into your head and soul.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>The tunes and sing-song during prayers in the Synagogue is based on the way it was done back in the Old Country; you either pick it up by going to prayers or learning it from someone. The Ashkenazim lost most of their tunes, but Middle Eastern and Oriental Jews have a very rich \"catalogue\", for lack of a better word.</p>\n\n\n",

Gentiles are not allowed to observe Shabbat, can Jews say Shabbat Shalom to gentiles to tell them what they don't have?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: -1)\n\n<p>There is no problem with the word \"Shabat\". However, the Gmara in Gitin (<a href=\"https://he.wikisource.org/wiki/%D7%92%D7%99%D7%98%D7%99%D7%9F_%D7%A1%D7%90_%D7%90\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">page 61</a>) states that one says Shalom to a Gentile \"to be in peace with them\" ('משום דרכי שלו). </p>\n\n<p>In Brachos (<a href=\"https://he.wikisource.org/wiki/%D7%91%D7%A8%D7%9B%D7%95%D7%AA_%D7%99%D7%96_%D7%90\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">page 17</a>) it is stated that one should always say Shalom to every person, including a Gentile in the market.</p>\n\n<p>So it seems that the answer is a clear \"yes\". </p>\n\n<p>However, there is a Machloikes between Rashi and Toisfois in Gitin (there). Rashi states the the Shalom that Rav Cahana said was not meant for the Gentile but for his Rav (\"שלא היה מתכוון לברך את הגוי, אלא כוונתו היתה לברך את רבו\"). And Toisfois says that it's hard to say such a thing since it is Gonev Daas (\"צריך עיון שלא יהא בזה גונב דעת הבריות\").</p>\n\n<p>Furthermore, there is a machloikes of the Taz and the Bach on the Shulchan Aruch (<a href=\"https://he.wikisource.org/wiki/%D7%A9%D7%95%D7%9C%D7%97%D7%9F_%D7%A2%D7%A8%D7%95%D7%9A_%D7%90%D7%95%D7%A8%D7%97_%D7%97%D7%99%D7%99%D7%9D_%D7%A4%D7%93\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Orach Chaim, 61</a>), if the word Shalom is considered Kdusha since it is one of Hashem's names. As a consequence, it would be forbidden to utter it the Beis HaMerchatz etc. And so the Bach tends to forbid saying Shalom with no Kdusha intent and the Taz tends to Lehakel, as when his friend's name is Shalom, in which case according to the Taz he can call him even in Beis HaMerchatz. It would seem that their Mechloikes may apply to saying Shabat Shalom to a Gentile.\nThe Mishna Beruru says (there) that it is allowed from Divrai Sofrim, but \"Yerei Shamayim\" should abstain from saying Shalom in such cases.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: -2)\n\n<p>Why not?

Nice dvar torah for her sheva brachot but I'm not sure that's the origin.</p>\n\n<p>Here are some of my own theories- they may be no less of a reach-</p>\n\n<p>1-Beila came from the hebrew בעלה itself a variant of בַּעֲלַת בַּיִת- she's the boss, the \"baalabusta\", the lady of the house, etc. I'm sure there are other connotations...\nSome yiddish speaking communities actually pronounce the Hebrew word בעלה as if it were written ביילא.\nAnecdotally, this meaning fits the personality of all the Beila's I know - they are tough and in charge...</p>\n\n<p>2- Beila is a contraction of some kind, the bei- in yiddish (and german) is a prefix meaning at. Which explains the common yinglish confusion of \"at\" and \"by\" in common speech, as in \"come pick me up, I'm by yeshiva.\" I don't know what the la would mean, but bei la could be some combination of words whose meaning became obscure with time.</p>\n\n<p>3- Perhaps the \"la\" in Beila is just a diminutive, as in many common names, like Feigela, Moishele, and so on - which would make the original name something like Bei- or Beil- or even some other name that starts with bei but got shortened and then diminutized. This could fit with the \"baalas habayis\" theory I already mentioned, or it could be some completely different word. Maybe it shares an etymology with Bagel, which comes from an old Germanic word for ring. Many possibilities, most of them far fetched.</p>\n\n<p>Anyone want to weigh in here?</p>\n\n<p>**Edit: According to my grandmother, the name in Hungary is pronounced Bella and is a shortened form of Isabella. </p>\n\n<p>This makes some sense, as Isabella is believed to be related to the Hebrew name Elisheva which could have undergone many dimunitions over the centures. Queen Isabella (of Poland/Hungary) was also a popular historical personage during the time that many Jews were settling in the region of modern day Austria, Hungary, and Slovakia - so it makes sense that the name could have come into popular usage as an easier alternative to Elisheva or Isabella.**</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Adjusting Potentiometer on Yom Tov (eg. oven temperature)\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>Can someone point me in the direction of some Halachic sources to research the subject of potentiometers on Yom Tov?</p>\n\n<p>In the case of an oven, I had the understanding that as long as the fire was on there was no problem to raise the oven temperature on YT. Specifically, I am discussing gas ovens with an electric igniter and a manual temperature control. I understand that the dial is actually a potentiometer and therefore any rotation of the dial is actually an electrical change in resistance.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>The situation is that the rheostat must be a continuous setting situation (analogous to a gas stove with the flame already on). If the dial causes the switch to click from one setting to another, then it is forbidden. Similarly, if an indicator light goes on and off as you turn the dial then it is forbidden. This is like a gas stove top with an electric spark that starts the flame (which is forbidden). This is as I explain at <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/46238/can-you-use-electricity-on-yom-tov/47258#47258\">Can you use electricity on Yom Tov</a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.star-k.org/articles/articles/kosher-appliances/4629/oven-kashrus-for-yom-tov-use/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Oven Kashrus For Yom Tov Use</a></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><strong>ELECTRIC OVENS</strong></p>\n  \n  <p>As with cooktops, one is forbidden to directly initiate a fire or heat\n  to an electric coil due to the prohibition of molid. If the oven was\n  turned on before Yom Tov, the temperature setting may be raised as\n  necessary for cooking if one is sure that electricity is flowing to\n  the element at that time or there is no digital readout. Also, one may\n  not cause a light or icon to go on during Yom Tov. If a light goes off\n  and on indicating when power is flowing to the heating element, then\n  the temperature may be raised when the light is on.</p>\n  \n  <p>Generally speaking, one may lower the temperature only if it is\n  necessary for the Yom Tov’s food and if a light or icon will not be\n  turned off.</p>\n  \n  <p>If an indicator light displays when power flows to the oven, one may\n  lower the oven temperature when power is not flowing (indicator light\n  is off) even if it is not needed for the food.</p>\n  \n  <p>Some Sabbath Mode ovens are designed to work on a delay when in\n  Sabbath Mode, the display will not change. In addition, this feature\n  permits raising the temperature on Yom Tov at any time, regardless of\n  when power is flowing to the oven. This is because when one adjusts\n  the dial or keypad, it is not directly causing the temperature of the\n  oven to change. Therefore, this action is considered a grama, an\n  indirect action, which will cause the temperature to be raised. Even\n  with these types of ovens, it is better to lower the temperature only\n  when necessary for food preparation or enjoyment of the Yom Tov.\n  (Other features of Sabbath mode ovens are discussed further in this\n  article.)</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

Accordingly, either B1) he said it but it is still incomprehensible (Shelah), or B2) he said it and it is comprehensible. Accordingly, either B2a) Rabbenu Hayyim holds that that there is actually still a mitsvah today, just that practically it is inadvisable (Haflaah), or B2b) he holds that that the mitsvah does not apply today. Accordingly, either he holds B2b-1) that there is nevertheless still a mitsvah kiyyumit if one lives in Israel (R. Feinstein), or B2b-2) he holds the mitsvah is entirely inapplicable today. Accordingly, either he holds B2b-2a) that the mitsvah only applies when one will practically carry out the mitsvot of the land (R. Klein), or B2b-2b) he holds that the mitsvah simply does not apply today, regardless (Beit Halevi).</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>Many poskim reference the view of Rabbenu Hayyim, but most do not attempt to explain his position. Indeed, <a href=\"https://he.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D7%99%D7%A9%D7%9E%D7%A2%D7%90%D7%9C_%D7%94%D7%9B%D7%94%D7%9F_%D7%9E%D7%9E%D7%95%D7%93%D7%A0%D7%94\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">R. Yishmael Hakohen of Modena</a> (cited in Daf Al HaDaf to Ketubot there) basically asks your question that \"danger\" and \"no mitsvah\" are two different things. </p>\n\n<p>Additionally, the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isaiah_Horowitz\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Shelah</a> (Shaar HaOtiot: Kof: Kedushat HaMakom 452) writes that besides for being a lone view, R. Hayyim's view basically doesnt make any sense for the reasons you outlined: That as with all mitsvot one is obligated to try to follow them, and if one does it is a mitsvah. Why should this be any different, and why is it impossible to do the mitsvot?</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>דברי רבינו חיים הם דברי יחיד. וגם לא מסתברא טעמיה, דעל זה נאמר (הושע יד, י) 'וצדקים ילכו בם ופשעים יכשלו [בם]', דודאי מי שדר בארץ ישראל ואינו מקיים מה שמחויב לקיים אז הוא פושע, אבל המקדש עצמו ומקיים, לענין תרומות ומעשרות ושביעית כפי מה אשר מחויב, אז אשריו. ומה שאמר דאין אנו יכולין ליזהר בהן, זה הדבר אין מובן אצלי. דלמה אין יכולין ליזהר, ומי הוא המונע. על כן אין להשגיח בדבריו אלו. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>One posek who does suggest an approach is <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Menashe_Klein\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">R. Menashe Klein</a> who writes in Shu\"t Mishneh Halakhot (8:11) that according to Rabbenu Hayyim, the very mitsvah of living in Israel is itself dependent on fulfilling the mitsvot there. If one may not be able to fulfill the mitsvot, then one would not even be obligated to live there. In passing he mentions that the purpose of God bringing us into Israel was to fulfill the mitsvot, as though this is the reason why only when one knows that he will fulfill the mitsvot is he even obligated:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>נלפענ\"ד לחדש <strong>דס\"ל לרבינו חיים ז\"ל דמצוה זו של ישוב ארץ ישראל קשורה בקיום שאר המצות</strong> כלומר דהגם דישנם מצות התלויות בארץ שאפשר לקיימם גם היום מ\"מ כיון דלאו כל המצות אפשר לקיימם וישנם מצות שא\"א לקיימם ממילא ליכא כלל מצות ישוב ארץ ישראל דאותה מצוה לא הוי בכלל מצוה אלא כשאפשר לקיים כל המצות התלויות בה וכל שא\"א לקיים כל המצות אלא מקצתן יהי' מאיזה טעם שיהי' אז ליכא חיוב לדור שם והדר שם אינו מקיים מצות ישוב א\"י הגם שישנם כמה מצות התלויות שמקיים וודאי יש לו שכר על קיום הני מצות מ\"מ <strong>לענין מצות ישוב ליכא רק באופן שאפשר לקיים כל המצות התלויות בארץ שהוא כעין תנאי במצות ישוב הארץ דליכא מצוה אלא באפשר לקיים כל המצות דע\"מ כן הכניסנו הקדוש ברוך הוא לא\"י</strong> ולכן בזה\"ז שא\"א לקיים ליכא מצות ישוב א\"י דהו\"ל כחסר בתנאי המצוה ולכן ס\"ל לר\"ח הכהן שפטור, ובאמת כי רבינו חיים לא כתב פטור אלא דליכא מצוה כלומר דאינו מצוה כלל לדור שם דהמצוה תלוי בתנאי הנ\"ל </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Another posek who addresses this is <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moshe_Feinstein\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">R. Moshe Feinstein</a> (Igrot Moshe EH Vol. V: 23). He again basically asks your question that whether or not one will have difficulty doing the mitsvot should have nothing to do with whether or not there is a mitsvah. Furthermore, he asks that nothing should have changed today; he assumes that it always would have been difficult keeping all the mitsvot in Israel, and that even R. Hayyim would concede that there used to be an obligation. If so, what changed?</p>\n\n<p>He answers that in the opinion of R. Hayyim there isn't really an obligation today, just a mitsvah if one does. Accordingly, if one will have difficulty with the mitsvot, one is not obligated:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>וצריך לומר דיש חילוק גדול. דבזמן הבית ודאי יש חיוב גדול על כל אחד מישראל לגור בארץ ישראל, ששם הוקבע מקום כל ישראל לגור שם ולהתחייב בכל המצוות התלויות שם. ולכן ודאי אין יכול מחשש שלא יוכל להזהר בהמצוות והענשים ליפטר מחיובו, דהם ככל המצוות שאינו רשאי לבקש תחבולות ליפטר מהן. </p>\n  \n  <p>אבל בזמן הזה שנגלינו מארצנו, ואין זה עתה בעוה\"ר המקום הקבוע לדירת כל\n  ישראל, ואין שייך כלל שיתחייבו כולם ליסע לשם לקבוע דירתם. ורק שמצוה\n  בעלמא ודאי מקיים כשגר בארץ ישראל, אבל לחייב מחמת מצוה זו ליסע לארץ\n  ישראל אין שייך כשאין בית המקדש קיים ואנו בגלות, לכן כשהוא חושש שלא\n  יוכל לעמוד עליהם שקשה ליזהר, אין עליו לחוש למצוה זו אף שודאי יש מצוה</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>This is very related to his responsum (EH Vol. I: 102) in which he is asked whether the halakha follows Ramban that the mitsvah of living in Israel applies today, or R. Hayyim Kohen's view. He answers that while the majority follow Ramban, that it is obvious that that is only a mitsvah kiyyumit, not an actual obligation (he does not differentiate, but presumably means that <em>today</em> it is not a full obligation). His proof is that poskim don't say it is forbidden to live outside of Israel, and Rambam just writes it is forbidden to leave. (Of course Ramban is coming to argue on Rambam in the first place, and R. Feinstein's whole point is that we hold like Ramban, so proving Ramban's position from Rambam is questionable).</p>\n\n<p>In this, R. Feinstein was mostly anticipated by the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yosef_Dov_Soloveitchik_(Beis_Halevi)\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Beit Halevi</a> (Shu\"t Vol. II: 50:3) who indicates that the reason of Rabbenu Hayyim would not be coherent were there an actual mitsvah to live in Israel. If there were, one would simply have to try one's best. However, his opinion is understandable in light of Rambam's view that the mitsvah of settling Israel does not apply today. Accordingly, the reason to live there would be in order to fulfill the mitsvot that can only be performed there. Accordingly, once that isnt practical, then the whole reason to live there today in the first place doesn't apply. Like R. Feinstein he predicates the view of Rabbeu Hayyim on there not being an actual obligation to live in Israel toady. However, according to R. Feinstein there is still a mitsvah kiyumit, while according to the Beit Halevi, there is no mitsvah at all today.</p>\n\n<p>Unlike Rabbis Feinstein and Klein who assume that according to Rabbi Hayyim there is actually no mitsvah at all today, The <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pinchas_Horowitz\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Haflaah</a> to Tosafot there writes that R. Hayyim doesn't mean that the mitsvah actually doesn't apply, but that although one is obligated to live in Israel and is sinning from refraining, he is avoiding bigger sins that he would encounter in not following halakha properly in Israel:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>ה\"נ אף דאין מצוה משום שיבא לידי קלות במצוות באיסור חמור [במצוות] התלויות בארץ, עבירה היא  </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Importantly, however, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Trani\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Maharit</a> (Shut Vol. II YD 28) argues at length that Rabbenu Hayyim Kohen never said this. He asserts that this is a later addition, and in reality he only said that in time of danger the mitsvah is not obligatory (as with any other non-cardinal mitsvah). One his pieces of evidence is the Hagahot Mordekhai (Ketubot 2:313) which quotes what Rabbenu Hayyim wrote and mentions only the issue of danger:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>ומכאן אתה למד שדברי הר' חיים אינן מיסוד התוס' ...והאיר את עיני שמצאתי בהגהות מרדכי כלשון הזה כת' רבינו חיים כהן בתשובה דה\"מ בימיהם שהיה שלום אבל עכשיו שהדרכים משובשים אינו יכול לכופה דהו\"ל כמו חפץ להוליכה למקום גדודי חיה ולסטים ואפי' אם יעמיד לה ערבים מגוף לממון ערביך ערבא צריך ע\"כ הרי שתשובת הר' חיים כהן ז\"ל לא באה אלא מטעם סכנת הדרכי' ומ\"ש בתו' דאין מצוה לדור בא\"י הגהת תלמיד היא ולאו דסמכא היא כלל </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Similarly, see <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_Suslin\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Agudah</a> to Ketubot (Ch. 13:171).</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>The <em>Baal Tosafot</em> seems to be saying that <em>yatza scharo b'hefsedo</em> - the potential merit of living there is overshadowed by serious infractions he is likely to commit, thereby voiding the moral imperative to live there.</p>\n\n\n",

Frank (<a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=20947&st=&pgnum=20\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Har Zvi OC 6</a>) was asked about one who has to relieve himself via a catheter and ruled that Asher Yazar is recited because there still exists the possibility of a malfunction and \"disconnect\" in which case the person would be left in pain. This opinion appears to be the consensus among contemporary <em>poskim</em> (cf. Birchat Eitan, Bnei Brak 2007, pg. 445). Now, although R. Frank may have been discussing a case where the catheter was inserted via the urethra, one may not be amiss in applying his reasoning to both dialysis and colostomy as well. Indeed R. Waldenberg (Tzitz Eliezer <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=14507&st=&pgnum=21&hilite=\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">vol. 8 no. 1, end</a>) applies the same to one who has a \"catheter running into the stomach\" (colostomy?) or via the kidney that he does recite the blessing. However, students of R. Shlomo Z. Auerbach record in his name (Halichos Shlomo, ch. 20, sec. Dvar Halacha n. 43) that while one on dialysis is obligated to thank God for the successful procedure he does not recite Asher Yazar since the blessing was not instituted where the body cleanses itself in this manner. R. Yitzchok Liebes (Beis 'Avi <a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=892&pgnum=54\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">vol. 2 no. 22</a>), after considering the same argument proposed by R. Auerbach, ruled that one should still recite the blessing even though the cleansing is not done the natural way; so ruled R. Isaac Herzog too (Heichal Yitzchok <a href=\"http://beta.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=22218&st=&pgnum=28&hilite=\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">OC 4</a>).    </p>\n\n<p>Re. the time to recite the blessing and what to do with the receptacle, the consensus from the above sources appear to rule that if there is a continuous drip, or one is not able to realize when any discharge occurred they should recite the blessing once in the morning and have in mind for the rest of the day. If, however, they can know or feel every time they were relieved they should recite it each time. The receptacle may be present as long as it is enclosed and does not emit a foul odor. If it contains feces or is in a clear tube it should be covered. </p>\n\n\n",

In fact an alternate was chosen for him to marry in case his wife passed away before Yom Kippur. Note that the lack of a wife is considered a defect (a mum) that disqualifies the Kohen Gadol from performing the Yom Kippur service and  entering the Kadosh Kedoshim.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.atzmut.com/question/why-a-cohen-gadol-has-to-be-married/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Why a Cohen Gadol has to be married?</a></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>We learn from the Torah that a Kohen Gadol must be married from the\n  pasuk (verse) וְהִקְרִיב אַהֲרֹן אֶת פַּר הַחַטָּאת אֲשֶׁר לוֹ\n  וְכִפֶּר בַּעֲדוֹ וּבְעַד בֵּיתוֹ.

A Cohen that has a blemish (what is called in\n  Hebrew moom מום) can not offer any sacrifices in the temple.</p>\n  \n  <p>We learn this rule from the verse: אִישׁ מִזַּרְעֲךָ לְדֹרֹתָם אֲשֶׁר\n  יִהְיֶה בוֹ מוּם לֹא יִקְרַב לְהַקְרִיב לֶחֶם אֱלֹהָיו -ויקרא כא יז</p>\n  \n  <p>Translation: “Speak to Aaron, saying: Any man among your offspring\n  throughout their generations who has a defect, shall not come near to\n  offer up his God’s food.” Vayikra – Leviticus – Chapter 21/17</p>\n  \n  <p>Therefore, in order for the Kohen Gadol to offer sacrifices, he must\n  be married in order not to be invalid or disqualified for the service.\n  You can find much more about this in the Zohar (Parashat Vayikra 5\n  page 2).</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>One example is from <a href=\"http://www.chabad.org/library/bible_cdo/aid/8166#showrashi=true&v=24\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Bereishis 2:24</a></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Therefore, a man shall leave his father and his mother, and cleave to\n  his wife, and they shall become one flesh.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>As it says in <a href=\"https://he.wikisource.org/wiki/%D7%A9%D7%95%D7%9C%D7%97%D7%9F_%D7%A2%D7%A8%D7%95%D7%9A_%D7%90%D7%91%D7%9F_%D7%94%D7%A2%D7%96%D7%A8_%D7%90\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Shulchan Oruch Even Haezer 1.1</a></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>סעיף א</p>\n  \n  <p>חייב כל אדם לישא אשה כדי לפרות ולרבות וכל מי שאינו עוסק בפריה ורביה\n  כאילו שופך דמים וממעט את הדמות וגורם לשכינה שתסתלק מישראל:</p>\n\n<pre><code>הגה: וכל מי שאין לו אשה שרוי בלא ברכה בלא תורה כו' ולא נקרא אדם וכיון שנשא אשה עונותיו מפקפקים שנאמר מצא אשה מצא טוב ויפק רצון מאת ה'\n</code></pre>\n  \n  <p>(טור):</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>And indeed in 1:8, one should marry even if he already has had children.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>סעיף ח</p>\n  \n  <p>אע\"פ שקיים פריה ורביה אסור לו לעמוד בלא אשה וצריך שישא אשה בת בנים אם\n  יש ספק בידו אפילו יש לו כמה בנים ואם אין ספק בידו לישא אשה בת בנים\n  אא\"כ ימכור ס\"ת אם אין לו בנים ימכור כדי שישא אשה בת בנים אבל אם יש לו\n  בנים לא ימכור אלא ישא אשה שאינה בת בנים ולא יעמוד בלא אשה וי\"א שאפילו\n  אם יש לו בנים ימכור ס\"ת כדי שישא אשה בת בנים:</p>\n\n<pre><code>הגה מיהו אם מכיר שאינו בן בנים עוד ואינו ראוי עוד להוליד ישא אשה שאינה בת בנים (נ\"י בפ' הבא על יבמתו) וכן אם יש לו בנים הרבה ומתיירא\n</code></pre>\n  \n  <p>שאם ישא אשה בת בנים יבאו קטטות ומריבות בין הבנים ובין אשתו מותר לישא\n  אשה שאינה בת בנים אבל אסור לישב בלא אשה משום חשש זו (ת\"ה סי' רפ\"ג):</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.dailyhalacha.com/m/halacha.aspx?id=1211\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Daily Halacha</a> points out that it is preferred that the shaliach tzibbur be married.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>May a congregation appoint an unmarried man to serve as the Chazan?</p>\n  \n  <p>This question is addressed in the work Orchot Chayim (by Rabbi Aharon\n  Hakohen of Lunel, France-Spain, 1280-1330), who records the practice\n  to appoint only married men to serve as Chazan.

(Either because he appears unwilling to accept <em>ol malchut shamayim</em> (Aruch Hashulchan OC 102:3) or because the area around one who is praying is considered holy (Aruch Hashulchan OC 102:4)).</p>\n\n<p>1. There is a debate regarding sitting down to learn torah in the presence of someone else praying; some hold that this is permitted as it does not connote disrespect to the prayer, as he is also involved in a form of <em>kabbalat ol malchut shamayim</em> and/or holy matters, but Tur holds it is forbidden, as it still conveys disrespect. (Aruch Hashulchan OC 102:3 - 4)</p>\n\n<p>[This is what is being referred to later in 102:9 as דעת הטור דתורה אינה פוטרת העמידה - the Tur's view that (in general) Torah study does not exempt one from standing.]</p>\n\n<p>2. What happens if the sitter was sitting first, and then the prayer started praying? The strict letter of the law is that we say that is the prayer's fault for starting to pray in the sitter's presence, and the sitter is exempt from standing, as there is no disrespect implied (Aruch Hashulchan OC 102:8).</p>\n\n<p><strong>The Aruch HaShulchan in OC 102:9</strong></p>\n\n<p>Aruch HaShulchan starts by noting that some limit the exemption in point 2 above (where the sitter was already sitting) to a private home. However, in a synagogue, where by definition people come to pray, we cannot fault the prayer for starting to pray in the pre-sitter's presence, and so the sitter must stand, <em>even though he was sitting first</em>.</p>\n\n<p>However, if the sitter was sitting first, <em>and was also studying torah</em>, we do not invoke the Tur's stringency (discussed in point 1 above) to say that he must stand. Rather, here, where he is sitting first <em>and</em> engaged in Torah study, he need not stand.</p>\n\n<p><strong>My own thoughts</strong></p>\n\n<p>From the Aruch HaShulchan's words, it is unclear to me why the Tur's stringency does not apply in this case. I have two possible explanations:</p>\n\n<p>a. We don't want to apply a double stringency: i) Torah study does not exempt standing (the stringency of the Tur) and ii) sitting first is not an exemption from standing in a synagogue;</p>\n\n<p>or</p>\n\n<p>b. The rationale for requiring a pre-sitting sitter to stand in a synagogue (because the prayer can reasonably expect to enter a synagogue and pray without being prevented by those sitting there and doing nothing) is not relevant here where the pre-sitter is behaving appropriately by sitting and learning. Thus, the prayer should not have started praying next to the one already sitting down, and therefore the sitter does not have to stand.</p>\n\n\n",

Or was it just an indulgence people enjoyed without thinking too much about it?</p>\n\n<p>I believe this is relevant because it could shed light on the way Jews attempt to find meaning and religious significance within mundane activities.

He also notes that if one doesn't have the proper materials to prepare his cigarette then he will waste even more time to find them.He also writes that if one adds up all the hours from the year to prepare and the time it takes to smoke it will add up to 100 of hours of bitul Torah.</p>\n\n<p>Regarding positive effects the Magen Avraham discusses the question regarding if one needs to make a bracha on a smoke pipe or not.He notes that people get benefit from it since it fills them up like they have eaten a food or drink.He doesn't say one should smoke ,he brings the reality of his day in age.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Text of Magen Avraham 210:9:</strong>\nצ\"ע באותן שנותנין עשב שקורין טוב\"ק לתוך השפופרת ומדליקין אותו ושואבין העשן לתוך פיהם וחוזרין ופולטין אותו צ\"ע אי דמי לטועם ופולט שא\"צ ברכה או דלמא דומה לריח שצריך לברך ק\"ו כאן שגם הגוף נהנה ממנו שהרבה שבעים ממנו כמו שאכל ושתה וצ\"ע, עסי' רי\"ו סי\"ג</p>\n\n<p><strong>Text of Zechor L'Miriam:</strong>\n<a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/5FNlk.jpg\" rel=\"noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/5FNlk.jpg\" alt=\"enter image description here\"></a>\n<a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/IoX5v.jpg\" rel=\"noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/IoX5v.jpg\" alt=\"enter image description here\"></a></p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 6)\n\n<p>The Previous Lubavitcher Rebbe (Rabbi Yosef Yitzchak Schneersohn) <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=31603&pgnum=99\" rel=\"noreferrer\">wrote a letter</a> in 1943 concerning smoking in the main Lubavitch yeshiva, \"Yeshiva Tomchei Tmimim\". </p>\n\n<p>He forbids smoking cigarettes, cigars, and pipes, saying that the yeshiva should be a \"no-smoking zone\" all 24 hours a day:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>.בלי הבדל אם פאפיראסן או סיגארן ופיפקעס, ואיסור זה חל על כל התלמידים בכל מקום שהם בכל משך כ''ד שעות המעל''ע</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Interestingly enough, the Previous Lubavitcher Rebbe himself smoked at least for a significant period of his life (see <a href=\"https://w3.chabad.org/media/images/3610.jpg\" rel=\"noreferrer\">this picture</a>) but perhaps he stopped sometime around the time he wrote the above letter (maybe once he realized the ill-effects of smoking). </p>\n\n<p>The Lubavitcher Rebbe (Rabbi Menachem Mendel Schneersohn) also has some interesting things to say on smoking, but of course it was after the 1950s (he assumed leadership in 1951). </p>\n\n<p>Additionally, Rebbe Nachman of Breslov (d. 1810) is recorded to have smoked a pipe for \"mystical significance\", but called smoking a \"very foolish habit\" and advised his followers against it:</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Chayei_Moharan.273.1?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Chayei Moharan 273</a></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>(לג) רַבֵּנוּ זִכְרוֹנוֹ לִבְרָכָה הִתְפָּאֵר שֶׁלֹּא הִתְחִיל לַעֲשׂוֹת שׁוּם דָּבָר בָּעוֹלָם קֹדֶם שֶׁיָּדַע הַסּוֹד שֶׁיֵּשׁ בּוֹ. וַאֲפִלּוּ מַה שֶּׁנּוֹהֲגִין לְהַעֲלוֹת עֲשַׁן הַטִּיטוּן עַל־יְדֵי לִילְקֶע וְצִבֶּעךְ (שֶׁקּוֹרִין לוּלְקֶא רֵייכֶערְן) [עִשּׁוּן טַבַּק] לֹא הִתְחִיל בָּזֶה עַד שֶׁיָּדַע סוֹד בְּהַנְהָגָה זוֹ. וְכַיּוֹצֵא בָּזֶה בִּשְׁאָר הַנְהָגוֹת לֹא הִתְחִיל שׁוּם דָּבָר לַעֲשׂוֹת עַד שֶׁיָּדַע סוֹד הַדָּבָר. וְאַף־עַל־פִּי שֶׁהוּא זִכְרוֹנוֹ לִבְרָכָה יָדַע סוֹד בְּעִנְיַן עֲשַׁן הַטִּיטוּן, אַף־עַל־פִּי־כֵן הִזְהִיר אוֹתָנוּ הַרְבֵּה לְהִתְרַחֵק מִזֶּה מְאֹד, וּפַעַם אַחַת דִּבֵּר הַרְבֵּה מֵעִנְיַן זֶה שֶּׁנּוֹהֲגִין הָעוֹלָם לְהַעֲשִׁין טִיטוּן וְאָמַר שֶׁהוּא שְׁטוּת גָּדוֹל, וּלְעִנְיַן נְקִיּוּת אֵינוֹ מוֹעִיל כְּלָל. וְכֵן הָרֵיחַ טַבַּק שֶׁהוּא גָּרוּעַ עוֹד יוֹתֵר, כַּמְבֹאָר שִׂיחָה זֹאת בְּמָקוֹם אַחֵר (לְקַמָּן תעב):</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>See also <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Chayei_Moharan.242.1?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"noreferrer\">242</a> and <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Chayei_Moharan.472.1?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"noreferrer\">472</a> for more on Rabbi Nachman's opinion of smoking.</p>\n\n\n",

Therefore, on Rosh Chodesh and Chol HaMoed where there's a Mussaf sacrifice, we call up 4. On Yom Tov when work is forbidden, we call up 5. On Yom Kippur 6, because its punishment is Karet. On Shabbat, since its punishment is stoning, we call up 7.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>So we see that Shabbat is considered superior to Yom Kippur according to the Gemara.

See Gemarah Rosh Hashanna that explains part of the <em>Lo Adu Rosh</em> rule (Rosh Hashanna cannot occur on Mon., Wed. or Fri.

Note that Shabbat is mentioned first because G-d sanctifies Shabbat. It is always on the seventh day of the week, and no man can change that date. (Shabbat is considered a holiday, BTW.) However, <em>Bnei Yisra'el</em> sanctifies Yom Kippur, as I just explained. Its date can be moved by rearranging the calendar.</p>\n\n\n",

On my plate is a tomato (<em>ha'adamah</em>), an apple and a date (both <em>ha'etz</em>). I want to eat them all now. In terms of my taste preferences, I rank them apple (most favourite) > tomato > date (least favourite).</p>\n\n<p>Which bracha do I make first: <em>ha'etz</em> or <em>ha'adamah</em>? And if <em>ha'etz</em>, on which item, the apple or the date?</p>\n\n<p><strong>Some background</strong></p>\n\n<p>I have always been taught, and this is also my understanding based on Shulchan Aruch, Orach Chaim, 211:1, with Mishnah Berurah, that for any two out of the three items listed above, the priority rules would be as follows:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Date > Apple (because both are <em>ha'etz</em>, and dates are of the <em>shivat haminim</em> where apples are not; in such a case personal preference is not taken into consideration)</li>\n<li>Apple > Tomato (because I prefer the apple)</li>\n<li>Tomato > Date (because one is <em>ha'etz</em> and one is <em>ha'adamah</em>, and I prefer the tomato; in such a case <em>shivat haminim</em> is not taken into consideration)</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>So I can prioritise between any two, but when I need to prioritise between all three I just go round in a circle: date takes priority over apple, which has priority over tomato, which has priority over date etc. etc.</p>\n\n<p>What do I do to break this loop, and why?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>I do not see the dilemma.  You have both fruits and vegetables before you. In such a situation, the priority for eating is: whole, haviv (preferred), 7 species, larger and, finally, eitz.  Since all are whole, you move to haviv.  You prefer apple, so you eat the apple.  It is only when you have only eitz foods in front of you that the 7 species take precedence. (Then the order of precedence is: 7 species, whole, haviv, and larger.)</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.dirshu.co.il/%D7%9B%D7%90%D7%A9%D7%A8-%D7%A8%D7%91%D7%99-%D7%A6%D7%91%D7%99-%D7%A4%D7%9C%D7%9E%D7%9F-%D7%A7%D7%9D-%D7%9E%D7%9E%D7%A7%D7%95%D7%9E%D7%95-%D7%A9%D7%90%D7%9C-%D7%90%D7%95%D7%AA%D7%95-%D7%94%D7%A1%D7%98/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">This article</a> (Hebrew) outlines two reasons to first say <em>ha'etz</em> on the date.</p>\n<ol>\n<li><p>R. Benzion Felman suggested (based on an a similar conundrum in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Zevachim.90b.8?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Zevachim 90b</a>) that the only reason to prefer the tomato is because of its status as <em>chaviv</em> (preferred). But the apple is even more <em>chaviv</em> than the tomato. So we proceed to ignore the tomato, as it is 'subsumed' into the apple's status. We then judge between the apple and the date, and choose the date based on its status as one of the <em>shiv'at haminim</em>.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>R. Ya'akov Yisra'el Kanievsky (the Steipler Ga'on) notes that we're dealing with two subtly different questions: a) whether to say <em>ha'etz</em> or <em>ha'adamah</em> first, and b) whether to say the <em>ha'etz</em> on the apple or the date. Question a) is resolved by choosing to say <em>ha'etz</em> first, because you prefer the apple to the tomato. Once you resolve that question, you resolve question b) in favor of saying <em>ha'etz</em> on the date (<em>shiv'at haminim</em>) <strong>but the <em>ha'etz</em> in this case still refers to the <em>chaviv</em> apple as well</strong>, which explain its precedence over the <em>ha'adamah</em> of the tomato.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n\n\n",

This declaration is\n  made in the presence of three people that serve as a Bet Din\n  (Rabbinical court). It absolves a person from vows he made and from\n  customs which he accepted upon himself. Preferably, a person should\n  perform Hatarat Nedarim in the presence of ten men, as this kind of\n  Bet Din has more authority than a three-member Bet Din.</p>\n  \n  <p>As part of the Hatarat Nedarim declaration, a person says that\n  although Halacha requires a person to specify the particular vows\n  which he wishes to annul, he is unable to do so because they are too\n  numerous. The work Derech Ha’haim cites from the Shiboleh Ha’leket\n  (Rav Sidkiya Ben Abraham, Italy, 1230-1300) that this special\n  provision applies only to vows of which a person is unaware. One can\n  earn annulment for these vows by informing the Bet Din that he cannot\n  recall his vows. If, however, a person is aware of a certain vow or\n  custom from which he wishes to absolve himself, then he must specify\n  it when he makes the Hatarat Nedarim declaration.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>This is better as it shows that a person has been careful about oaths and would not rely on the general statement.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/articles/9443-kol-nidre/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Kol Nidre</a></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The readiness with which vows were made and the facility with which\n  they were annulled by the scribes gave the Karaites an opportunity to\n  attack the Rabbinites, and forced the Geonim to minimize the power of\n  dispensation. Yehudai Gaon of Sura (760), author of the \"Halakot\n  Pesuḳot,\" went so far as to forbid any study whatsoever of Nedarim,\n  the Talmudic treatise on oaths (Alfasi on Nedarim, end; L. Löw, l.c.\n  p. 363). Thus the \"Kol Nidre\" was discredited in both of the\n  Babylonian academies and was not accepted by them (S. K. Stern, in\n  \"Ḳebuẓat Ḥakamim,\" ed. Warnheim, 1861), as is affirmed by the geonim\n  Naṭronai (853-856) and Hai Bar Naḥshon (889-896; Müller, \"Mafteaḥ,\" p.\n  103; Cassel, \"Teshubot Geonim Ḳadmonim,\" p. 9; Zunz, \"Ritus,\" p. 189;\n  Ṭur Oraḥ Ḥayyim, § 619; \"Kol Bo,\" § 68). Amram Gaon in his \"Siddur\"\n  (l.c.) calls the custom of reciting the \"Kol Nidre\" a foolish one\n  (\"minhag sheṭut\"). According to Naṭronai, however, it was customary to\n  recite the formula in various lands of the Jewish dispersion, and it\n  is clear likewise from Amram's \"Siddur\" (ii. 37a) that the usage was\n  wide-spread as early as his time in Spain. But the geonic practise of\n  not reciting the \"Kol Nidre\" was long prevalent; it has never been\n  adopted in the Catalonian or in the Algerian ritual (Zunz, l.c. p.\n  106); and there were always many congregations in lands where the\n  Provençal and Spanish ritual was used which did not recite it (\"Orḥot\n  Ḥayyim,\" p. 105d; comp. also RaN to Ned. 23b, where it is said: \"There\n  are some congregations which usually recite the 'Kol Nidre' on the Day\n  of Atonement\")</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://etzion.org.il/en/kol-nidrei-and-repentance-yom-kippur\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rabbeinu Tam</a> states that it only effects the future and not the past.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Rabbenu Tam (1100–1171), however, disagrees, and raises many\n  objections to the traditional understanding of Kol Nidrei (Rosh, Yoma\n  8:28). He insists that Kol Nidrei does not affect the past by\n  annulling previous vows, but rather stipulates that any vow that one\n  will take in the future should not be binding. Indeed, the Talmud\n  (Nedarim 23b) teaches:</p>\n  \n  <p>And he who desires that none of his vows made during the year shall be\n  valid, let him stand at the beginning of the year and declare, \"Every\n  vow which I may make in the future shall be null.\"  [His vows are then\n  invalid,] provided that he remembers this at the time of the vow. But\n  if he remembers, has he not cancelled the declaration and confirmed\n  the vow? ... Raba said: … Here the circumstances are, for example,\n  that one stipulated at the beginning of the year, but does not know in\n  reference to what. Now he vows. Hence, if he remembers [the\n  stipulation] and he declares: \"I vow in accordance with my original\n  intention,\" his vow has no reality. But if he does not declare thus,\n  he has cancelled his stipulation and confirmed his vow.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Consistent philosophy in the Shulchan Aruch\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>If the Shulchan Aruch primarily rules based on a majority based on the Rif, Rambam and the Rosh, who each (I'm assuming) are usually philosophically internally consistent, then wouldn't the Shulchan Aruch be philosophically internally inconsistent?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>No. The philosophy is that majority rules; in that philosophy it is generally consistent.</p>\n\n<p>You could ask the same question about any multi-member court or a legislature. Is it philosophically inconsistent because the majority which rules consists of different individuals each time there is a vote? No, because the philosophy that matters is not the philosophy of each individual, who is not himself the court or legislature anymore than the mailman or janitor is. The relevant philosophy is that of the court itself, which is nothing except the procedures that govern it.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>Let us set up the following steps:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>The Shulchan Aruch always follows the majority of Rif, Rambam, and Rosh.</li>\n<li>Each of the three (Rif, Rambam, and Rosh) are philosophically consistent.</li>\n<li>If none of the three ever changed position on a philosophical matter, then the majority view on the philosophical matter can never have changed either.</li>\n<li>If the Shulchan Aruch always follows the majority and the majority can never change, ergo the Shulchan Aruch can never change.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Thus, assuming the premises to be true, it should be mathematically impossible for the Shulchan Aruch to be philosophically inconsistent. Any philosophical inconsistencies that do exist would have to be exceptions to one of the premises – either one of the three sources was inconsistent, or the Shulchan Aruch did not follow the majority in (at least one) of the cases.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>If I understand your question and assumptions correctly, I think the answer is no. I think this is what you mean: two different halakhot can depend on the same underlying issue. For example, Rabbi Yehudah and Rabbi Shimon disagree regarding muktze in many cases. Let's say two of those cases are Case A and Case B. So if Posek X rules Case A is not muktze it must be because he holds like Rabbi Shimon and therefore should hold Case B is also not muktze.</p>\n<p>Based on your premises, there should be no case where the Shulchan Aruch is internally inconsistent because if Halakhah A really implies Halakhah B, there should be the same majority for both halakhot. Going back to our example above, if The Rosh and Rambam both rule Case A is not muktze and the Rif holds it is muktze, then there should be the same 2-1 split in Case B and the Shulchan Aruch would be consistent. On the other hand, if the Rambam holds C and D, the Rif holds C and -D, and the Rosh holds -C and -D, then halakhot C and D must not actually depend on each other (according to your premises) and there would be no inconsistency for the SA to rule C and -D.</p>\n<p>I can't think of a scenario where you'd have consistency among the 3 sources but inconsistency in the SA. Can you construct an example?</p>\n<p>Anyway, even if there were such a configuration of rulings, I don't think it would necessarily be \"inconsistent.\" The SA sometimes concludes that as a practical matter we should be machmir on a safek, which can sometimes imply chumrot in both directions. For example, I don't think it would be \"inconsistent\" to say that since we don't know the exact temperature of yad soledet bo we hold it's a lower number when it comes to the isur to heat food on shabat but that it's a higher number when it comes to returning liquids to the fire.</p>\n<p>Separately, as many other responses point out, OP's premises are flawed and/or vague. The Mechaber was not a robot and did not resolve all issues on a \"best of three\" basis. Furthermore, there are many (apparent) contradictions in the Rosh, Rambam, and Rif. But I do think as you've presented it it's an interesting logic puzzle.</p>\n\n\n",

Presumably, the Rabbi Yishmoel is the one identified by the Rambam earlier as well since he doesn't clarify anyone else, even though he authors a work starting from Shemos and someone much later authors Bereishis.</p>\n\n<p>Rabbi Akiva and Rabbi Yishmoel are several generations before Rabbeinu HaKadosh. And although the Rambam allows that things were written for personal use before Rabbeinu HaKadosh, these works don't appear to be personal notes.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>I believe most scholars (if not all) do not interpret the Rambam as suggested in the question. Instead, the Rambam is referring to the Mechilta of R. Shimon [bar Yochai] whose collection is generally in accordance with R. Akiva. </p>\n\n<p>The initial groundbreaking work was done by Friedmann, which he treats in his intro. to his Mekhilta edition (<a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=38922&st=&pgnum=67\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here, s.v. מעתה</a>), and demonstrated that Rambam was referring to what we have today 'Mekhilta of Rashbi'. Later R. DZ Hoffman published his edition of the newly organized Mekhilta of Rashbi on Shemot and corroborated (<a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=38923&st=&pgnum=4\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a>) Friedmann's theory(ies). See also Prof. Finkelstien's perceptive take on the Rambam's phrasing here versus his phraseology in his intro. to the Mishnah (<a href=\"https://www.jstor.org/stable/1452437?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a>), intimating that \"Mekhilta of R. Akiva\" was compiled by Rashbi. See R. Kasher (<a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=52260&st=&pgnum=12&hilite=\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">note 5</a>) for another later example of agreement (unanimous, AFAIK) on interpreting Rambam here.</p>\n\n<p>Regarding the general question when the Tannaitic Midrashim assumed textual form, Albeck shows in his מבוא לתלמודים & מבוא למשנה that it was after the closing of the Talmud. Until then the texts (i.e. the lessons) were transmitted orally slowly gaining structure and organization.  </p>\n\n\n",

A sukkah that does not satisfy these requirements can be rectified by adding a square tefah of skhakh. (ibid). Therefore a Sukkah definitely can be made before Yom Kippur, it just might not be as good.</p>\n\n<p>Lets get back to the Rama, and see if it is even a reason that it would not be so good to wait. In Darkhei Moshe (OH 624) and ShA (OH 624:5) he cites Maharil and Mahari Weill who write that it is good to start making the sukkah after Yom Kippur in accordance with the verse (Psalms 84) \"Let them go from strength to strength\". The emphasis seems to be that right after finishing one holy endeavour it is appropriate to begin another. It does not seem to be discouraging doing it earlier.</p>\n\n<p>Additionally, the notion that limits this to the skhakh seems to overly focused on the technical mitsvah component, rather than on the general point of being occupied with good things. </p>\n\n<p>Lastly, in Shulhan Arukh (OH 625:1) Rama writes that one should make the Sukkah after Yom Kippur, since if one has the opportunity to do a mitsvah he should not delay. Accordingly, there would certainly be no reason to specifically delay construction until after Yom Kippur, since the whole point of doing it right after Yom Kippur, is to not delay!</p>\n\n<p>There might be other nice reasons to work on the Sukkah after Yom Kippur, see Birkei Yosef (OH 624:3) but it is not clear that any of these reasons are more important that doing mitsvot earlier if one has the opportunity.</p>\n\n<p>Thus, besides for the fact that there is no problem making it before, it is not clear that there would even be an advantage to waiting until after Yom Kippur, although if one waited until after Yom Kippur, there would be reasons to start work on the Sukkah right away.</p>\n\n<p><em>Assuming one did wait until after Yom Kippur</em>, as noted Rama (625:1) writes that it is proper to make it (letaken) right after Yom Kippur, and he also writes (624:5) that it is nice to start building it on motsaei Yom Kippur. The P'ri M'gadim (Mishb'tsot Zahav 624:3) claim that in (625:1) he means finishing the Sukkah, while in (624:3) he means starting construction. Furthermore, he claims that (625:1) refers to the next day in particular. Thus, he concludes that it is best to start construction on Motsaei Yom Kippur, and finish by the next day. </p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>See <a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=49628&st=&pgnum=167\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">O.C. 524:5</a></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>והמדקדקים מתחיליס מיד במוצאי יו\"כ בעשיית הסוכה כדי לצאת ממצוה אל מצוה</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>My translation:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Those who are precise begin immediately after Yom Kippur (at night) to\n  make the Succah, so that they can proceed from one mitzvah (Fasting on\n  Yom kippur, etc.) to another one.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>View sf 19 that says one should finish it by the next day (i.e., the daytime of Tishrei 11.)

Nevertheless, actually, they said the following established halakha: A woman may fill an entire pot with meat to cook on a Festival, although she requires only one piece for that day, and all the remainder will be for the following day... Rabbi Shimon ben Elazar says: A woman may fill the entire oven with bread, although she does not intend to use it all on that day, because bread bakes well when the oven is full. A full oven has less empty space and is therefore hotter; consequently, filling the oven with bread serves not only to provide bread for the next day but also to improve the bread to be eaten that same day. Rava said: The halakha is in accordance with the opinion of Rabbi Shimon ben Elazar.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Following the unanimous agreement among medieval rabbis, the Shulchan Aruch (<a href=\"https://he.m.wikisource.org/wiki/%D7%A9%D7%95%D7%9C%D7%97%D7%9F_%D7%A2%D7%A8%D7%95%D7%9A_%D7%90%D7%95%D7%A8%D7%97_%D7%97%D7%99%D7%99%D7%9D_%D7%AA%D7%A7%D7%92#.D7.A1.D7.A2.D7.99.D7.A3_.D7.90\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">OC 503:1</a>) codifies as follows:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>אסור לאפות או לבשל או לשחוט ביום טוב לצורך מחר... אבל ממלאה אשה קדרה בשר אף על פי שאינה צריכה אלא לחתיכה אחת</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Based on this, it would be permitted for one to prepare, e.g., a pot of rice which only partial would be for consumption on the holiday (since food comes out tastier when prepared in larger units; cf. Bet Yosef op. cit.). More so,  Rema goes further and states:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>וכן יכולה לבשל הרבה קדרות ולאכול מכל אחת מעט </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Meaning, if one were to prepare separate pots of rice (for example), intending to have them for after holiday*, in which case it is recognizable that the multiple pots are not for the current meal, as long as something of each pot is consumed now it would be permissible.</p>\n\n<p>However, all agree that it is prohibited -in the first place- to prepare food for another time after having completed one's meal and taste from the newly prepared. For example, if one does not need (any longer) rice for his holiday meal and needs it only for afterwards so in order to take advantage of this legal subterfuge he eats some rice - this is what's called \"הערמה\" (artifice) and is prohibited, as further codified by SA (ibid.):</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>ודוקא קודם אכילה אבל אחר אכילה אינה יכולה לבשל ולומר אוכל ממנה כזית דהוי הערמה מיהו אם עברה ובשלה (או שחטה) מותר לאוכלו</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Whether or not it is permissible for one to explicitly say that some of the food is intentionally being prepared for after the holiday is a matter of dispute, cf. Bet Yosef (ibid.). </p>\n\n<p>*R. Ovadiah Yosef (Chazon Ovadiah on Yom Tov pg. 38) cites this ruling and draws no differentiation between preparing for second day of holiday or for after holiday. </p>\n\n\n",

My understanding of Avodah Zara is the actions are prohibited even if one doesn't believe in what their doing. Here you're not doing any actions, but you're thinking about doing them.

For instance the Book of Ruth was written by Shmuel Hanavi to back up the psak that Ruth was a legitimate convert so that King David was a legitimate king. The Book of Esther was written to establish Purim. The 24 books of the Tanach were canonized by he Anshei Knesses Hagedola (Men of the Great Assembly), which included the last prophets in order to establish which books were legitimate at the end of the Babylonian exile and the start of the second temple.</p>\n\n<p>I notice that you ask about the Bavli as well. This is the question as to why the oral law was written in the Mishna and Talmud and is different from the other question. This is dealt with at length in <a href=\"http://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/3347866/jewish/What-Is-the-Talmud.htm\" rel=\"noreferrer\">How and why was the Oral Torah written?</a></p>\n\n<p>While originally the oral law was <strong>forbidden</strong> to be written down in order to ensure that each generation learned directly from the previous generation, eventually problems arose because of the persecutions that forced us to write the notes and discussions.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>For over a thousand years, from the days of Moses until the days of\n  Rabbi Yehudah the Prince (late 2nd century CE), no one had composed a\n  written text for the purpose of teaching the Oral Law in public.\n  Instead, in each generation, the head of the court or the prophet of\n  that generation would take notes of the teachings which he received\n  from his masters for himself, and teach them orally in public.\n  Similarly, individuals would write notes for themselves of what they\n  had heard regarding the explanation of the Torah, its laws, and the\n  new concepts that were deduced in each generation concerning laws that\n  were not communicated by the oral tradition, but rather derived using\n  one of the thirteen principles of biblical exegesis and accepted by\n  the high court.<sup>10</sup> For while there was a prohibition against writing\n  the Oral Torah, it applied only to actually transmitting it through\n  writing; however, one was permitted to write it down for personal\n  use.<sup>11</sup></p>\n  \n  <p>With the rise of the Greek and Roman empires and their persecution of\n  the Jews during the Second Temple era, it became increasingly harder\n  to learn and transmit Torah teachings from teacher to student.\n  Additionally, during this era there were disputes in Jewish law that,\n  due to the increase in decrees against Torah learning, remained\n  unsettled, since doing so would require peace and calm.</p>\n  \n  <p>By the time the schools of Hillel and Shammai became well established\n  in the century before the destruction of the Temple, disputes on the\n  law had become so widespread that there was fear that it would\n  eventually seem like there were really “two Torahs.” The unsettled\n  conditions prevented the sages of those times from resolving these\n  disputes, or even at least organizing and categorizing them.<sup>12</sup></p>\n  \n  <p>It was not until the days of Rabbi Yehudah the Prince, who enjoyed a\n  strong bond of friendship with the Roman emperor Antoninus, that there\n  was some respite from the Roman persecutions.</p>\n  \n  <p>Rabbi Yehudah and his colleagues, foreseeing future turmoil and the\n  increasing dispersal of the Jewish people throughout the Diaspora,\n  which would then lead to further uncertainties about the Oral Law,\n  used this period of peace to set about collecting all the teachings,\n  laws and commentaries that had been heard from Moses and which were\n  taught by the courts in each generation concerning the entire Torah.\n  After analyzing these teachings, Rabbi Yehudah composed a single\n  authoritative text that would be available to everyone.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>This was the Mishna. The Talmud eventually had to be written to clarify problems in the mishna as it was written in a very terse style, since much of it still remained oral.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The sages of the Talmudic period, known as amora’im, continued to\n  study, expound, clarify and elucidate the Mishnah, as well as\n  developing their own new insights based upon the rules of\n  extrapolation.</p>\n  \n  <p>Shortly after Rabbi Yehudah’s death, attacks and persecutions against\n  the Jews living in Israel intensified and the migration of Jews to\n  Babylonia increased. This migration included many of the leading sages\n  of the time, including Rabbi Abba Aricha (better known as Rav), one of\n  Rabbi Yehudah’s leading disciples. Other sages and students of Rabbi\n  Yehudah, such as Rabbi Chiya and later Rabbi Yochanan bar Nafcha (who\n  as a young boy attended Rabbi Yehudah’s lectures), remained in Israel.\n  Thus for a while there were major centers of learning, yeshivot, in\n  both Babylonia and Israel, and some amora’im regularly traveled back\n  and forth between them, bringing the teachings of each center of\n  learning to the other center.</p>\n  \n  <p>Rabbi Yochanan (d. approx. 4050/290 CE) became the leading Talmudic\n  authority in the Land of Israel. He began gathering the teachings and\n  explanations of the post-Mishnaic sages, and this became the basis of\n  what later became known as the Talmud Yerushalmi (Jerusalem Talmud).\n  Subsequent generations of amora’im in Israel continued to add various\n  teachings, especially aggadic (homiletic and non-legal) ones. However,\n  work on the Jerusalem Talmud was halted somewhat abruptly when the\n  Roman ruler Gallus, in the year 4111/351 CE, attacked and devastated\n  the Land of Israel, instituting harsh decrees against the Jews. Most\n  of the remaining sages fled to Babylonia, and the Jerusalem Talmud\n  remained in its rudimentary form.</p>\n  \n  <p>Meanwhile the centers of learning in Babylonia continued to flourish,\n  and it was not until around the year 4152/392 CE that Rav Ashi,\n  together with his colleague Ravina I, undertook the editing of what\n  was to become the Talmud Bavli (Babylonian Talmud). They gathered the\n  teachings of the earlier sages, organized and clarified their\n  statements about the Mishnah and the discussions of the amora’im on\n  these, and presented these in a logical and comprehensible\n  way.<sup>25</sup></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

However, when we light the candles on shabbat, the candles are lit first and then the blessing is said.  (I've seen the chanukah candles get lit first and then the blessing said, and I've seen it the other way around - I do not see a clear consensus one way or the other.  Chanukah is a minor holiday.  Shabbat is a big deal).</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 7)\n\n<p>In general, a blessing is recited prior to the performance of a mitzvah. However, the blessing over shabbat candles is an exception. While there is some debate over the matter, common custom is to light the candles and only then recite the blessing. (Note: this is true for Ashkenazic practice; I don't know what the Sephardic and other non-Ashkenazic practices are.)</p>\n\n<p>The reason it is done this way, is because it is assumed that one accepts the start of Shabbat when saying this blessing. Thus, it would be forbidden to light the candles after saying the blessing, as lighting a fire is one of the 39 melachot (categories of \"work\" forbidden on Shabbat). Therefore the candles are lit first, and only then is the blessing recited and Shabbat accepted.</p>\n\n<p>In order to comply with the general principle as far as possible, the custom is to cover the eyes immediately after lighting the candles, to avoid \"benefiting\" from the light of the candles before the blessing is said.</p>\n\n<p>Source: Rema to Shulchan Aruch Orach Chaim 263:5, with commentary of Mishna Berura</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: -1)\n\n<p>I have heard (unfortunately I have no source) that this is  the reason why there is a widespread custom for the woman to cover her eyes after lighting the Shabbos candles.

Why not say that being embarrassed in one sin atones for that sin?</li>\n<li>What is the wording of מוחלין - “we” atone - as opposed to נמחלין - his sins are atoned for? We humanly courts aren’t the ones who atone sins. </li>\n</ul>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 6)\n\n<p>The plural expression is common in Hazalic literature that refers to divine involvement with man, thus for example, Shabbat (104a) which famously states that man is allowed to sin, but helped to purify himself:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>בא ליטמא - פותחין לו, בא ליטהר - מסייעים אותו</p>\n  \n  <p>One who comes to become impure, <em>they</em> allow him, one who comes to become pure, <em>they</em> help him.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>For many additional examples, see the bottom of this post.</p>\n\n<p>Regarding Berakhot 10b, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Menachem_Meiri\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Meiri</a> (there) (who perhaps had a variant text) actually writes exactly what you propose; that feeling bad for a sin atones for that sin:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>כל העושה דבר ומתבייש בו מוחלים לו על אותו דבר </p>\n  \n  <p>Anyone who does something and is embarrassed about it, is forgiven <strong>for that thing</strong>.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The Havruta there (note 40) cites <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yom_Tov_Asevilli\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Ritva</a> (If anyone has access to it, please edit it in) who similarly writes that every sin that a person does is forgiven if he feels about it.</p>\n\n<p>Importantly, a very very similar passage in Hagiga (5a) states precisely that; that one who regrets a sin is forgiven for <em>it</em>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>אמר רבי חנינא בר פפא: כל העושה דבר ומתחרט בו - מוחלין לו מיד </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>However, the plot thickens for R. Yosef Gikatilla quotes the passage in Hagiga in Klalei HaMitsvot (חרט) as stating that all sins are forgiven! This same version of the Gemara Hagiga appears elsewhere in his book (כפרה). Furthermore, while many Rishonim and some manuscripts (e.g. Munich 95, Oxford Opp. Add., London - BL Harl. 5508 (400), and Goettingen 3) support our reading of Hagiga that it is that particular sin that is forgiven, R. Gikatilla's reading is also supported by some manuscripts (Munich 6, Spanish Print (c. 1480), and Vatican 134 which states מוחלין לו עוונותיו)</p>\n\n<p>Although it is possible that the Meiri and Ritva had a variant text, in accordance with the passage in Hagiga, I have found no variant manuscripts of the passage in Berakhot, and Munich 95, Oxford Opp., and Paris 671 all state that all sins will be forgiven. It is therefore also possible that Ritva and / or Meiri had the same text but explained that every sin can be forgiven by feeling bad about it, not that feeling bad for one will atone for all.</p>\n\n<p>Alternatively, the Havruta suggests that the embarrassment leads to atonement for other sins, since it is a form of suffering. They cite <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chaim_Leib_Shmuelevitz\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">R. Hayyim Shmulevitz</a> (31:5, 32:11) who writes that the purpose of suffering for sins is to take Man off his high horse, once one feels embarrassed for his sin, this is accomplished, and further suffering is unnecessary:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>שכל מטרת היסורים הם לבייש את האדם, כי הם מגלים על פחיתות כוחו, וע\"י העונש נוכח בטעותו, והמתבייש בעבירה הגיע מעצמו להכרה זו שהיא מטרת היסורים, ואינו צריך לעונש נוסף</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Additionally, for context, it should be noted that elsewhere Hazal state that all of ones sins to be forgiven. For example, in reward for  \"letting it go after one bothers you\", Rosh HaShana (17a) and Yoma (23a) state: מעבירין לו על כל פשעיו or according to the text in Megillah (28a): \nמעבירין ממנו כל פשעיו. (As a side note, note the plural expression). Similarly, note Pirkei D'Rabbi Eliezer (ed. Higger ch. 19) that if one observes Shabbat all of his sins will be forgiven. Note also Alpha Beta of Ben Sira in Otsar HaMidrashim (p. 38) that of one gives charity all of his sins will be forgiven. A similar statement is found in Midrash Iyyov (in Batei Midrashot Vol. II: 45). Other Hazalic sources also throw around expressions about all of one's sins being forgiven, see e.g. Vayikra Rabba (ed. Margolis ch. 19). While these might all be literal, perhaps it is a common phrase used as an exaggeration. </p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>Additional examples of the plural usage in Hazal to refer to divine involvement with man are the following:</p>\n\n<p>The bond between the <em>yavam</em> and the <em>yevama</em>  is automatically (divinely) created. The rabbis refer to this in Nedarim (10:6)  as a wife which he got from heaven, again using the plural:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>אשה שהקנו לו מן השמים</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>This is expression is also used in Ketubot (82b), Yevamot (39a), and Nedarim (74a).</p>\n\n<p>Similarly, note <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Berakhot.54b.22?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Berakhot (55a)</a> that there are three things things whose performance leads to divinely long life, again using the plural:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>ואמר רב יהודה שלשה דברים [המאריך בהן] מאריכין ימיו ושנותיו של אדם</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Similarly, Berakhot (57a) states:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>הרואה הספד בחלום - מן השמים חסו עליו ופדאוהו </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Similarly, note Hagiga (5b) that states that \"they\" recount to a person his speech to his wife:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>אמר רב: אפילו שיחה יתירה שבין איש לאשתו מגידים לו לאדם בשעת מיתה.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Similarly, Shabbat (127b) states that if one judges other favourably, \"they\" judge him favourably. From context is clear that this refers to God, as noted by Sfat Emet there:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>הדן חבירו לכף זכות דנין אותו לזכות </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Similarly, Sotah (1:7) states that \"in the measure that a person acts, so too \"they\" mete out to him:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>במדה שאדם מודד בה מודדין לו </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>This statement is found in Tosefta Sotah (1:7, 3:1, 4:1) and in the Talmud Megillah (12b), and in Sotah (8b), and in the Yerushalmi Sotah (1:7).</p>\n\n<p>Similarly, Tosefta Sh'vuot (3:1) states that \"they are not obligated to pay according to the law, but 'they' do not forgive him in heaven, until he pays.\"</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>אין חייבין לשלם מן הדין ואין מן השמים מוחלין להן עד שישלמו </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The same expression is found later in the Tosefta there (3:2, 3:3, 3:4).</p>\n\n<p>Similar usages are present in Berakhot (55b), Shabbat (129a), Pesahim (66b), Taanit (14b), Moed Kattan (15a), Yevamot (42a), Sotah (2a), Bava Kamma (55a), Bava Metsia (59b), Hulin (92a), Yerushalmi Yevamot (16:3), Sifrei (B'haalot'kha 78), Sifrei Zuta (11:16), Sifrei (Ekev 40), Sifrei (R'eh 96), Leviticus Rabba (ed.

(This is a major theme in the books of Yirmiya and Yonah, among others.)</p>\n\n<p>Yet, when HaShem decreed that the 10 martyrs should be killed, when the angels pleaded in their defense, HaShem said that if anyone says another word, He will destroy the entire world (paraphrased from the piyut in Yom Kippur Mussaf, page 590 in the Artscroll Machzor). Why is this case different? Why wouldn’t HaShem allow their case to be argued, as in other decrees of evil?</p>\n\n<p>Granted we see such responses in cases like HaShem refusing Moshe’s pleas to enter Eretz Yisrael, but at least in those cases it’s a simple “no.” Why here does he not only refuse their pleas but also threatens to destroy the world if they continue?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>See <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Menachot.29b.3-5?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://www.sefaria.org/Menachot.29b.3-5?lang=bi</a></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>אמר רב יהודה אמר רב בשעה שעלה משה למרום מצאו להקב\"ה שיושב וקושר כתרים\nלאותיות אמר לפניו רבש\"ע מי מעכב על ידך אמר לו אדם אחד יש שעתיד להיות\nבסוף כמה דורות ועקיבא בן יוסף שמו שעתיד לדרוש על כל קוץ וקוץ תילין\nתילין של הלכות אמר לפניו רבש\"ע הראהו לי אמר לו חזור לאחורך הלך וישב\nבסוף שמונה שורות ולא היה יודע מה הן אומרים תשש כחו כיון שהגיע לדבר אחד\nאמרו לו תלמידיו רבי מנין לך אמר להן הלכה למשה מסיני נתיישבה דעתו חזר\nובא לפני הקב\"ה אמר לפניו רבונו של עולם יש לך אדם כזה ואתה נותן תורה\nע\"י אמר לו שתוק כך עלה במחשבה לפני אמר לפניו רבונו של עולם הראיתני\nתורתו הראני שכרו אמר לו חזור [לאחורך] חזר לאחוריו ראה ששוקלין בשרו\nבמקולין אמר לפניו רבש\"ע זו תורה וזו שכרה א\"ל שתוק כך עלה במחשבה לפני</p>\n<p>Rav Yehuda says that Rav says: When Moses ascended on High, he found\nthe Holy One, Blessed be He, sitting and tying crowns on the letters\nof the Torah. Moses said before God: Master of the Universe, who is\npreventing You from giving the Torah without these additions? God said\nto him: There is a man who is destined to be born after several\ngenerations, and Akiva ben Yosef is his name; he is destined to derive\nfrom each and every thorn of these crowns mounds upon mounds of\nhalakhot. It is for his sake that the crowns must be added to the\nletters of the Torah.</p>\n<p>Moses said before God: Master of the Universe, show him to me. God\nsaid to him: Return behind you. Moses went and sat at the end of the\neighth row in Rabbi Akiva’s study hall and did not understand what\nthey were saying. Moses’ strength waned, as he thought his Torah\nknowledge was deficient. When Rabbi Akiva arrived at the discussion of\none matter, his students said to him: My teacher, from where do you\nderive this? Rabbi Akiva said to them: It is a halakha transmitted to\nMoses from Sinai. When Moses heard this, his mind was put at ease, as\nthis too was part of the Torah that he was to receive.</p>\n<p>Moses returned and came before the Holy One, Blessed be He, and said\nbefore Him: Master of the Universe, You have a man as great as this\nand yet You still choose to give the Torah through me. Why? God said\nto him: Be silent; this intention arose before Me. Moses said before\nGod: Master of the Universe, You have shown me Rabbi Akiva’s Torah,\nnow show me his reward. God said to him: Return to where you were.\nMoses went back and saw that they were weighing Rabbi Akiva’s flesh in\na butcher shop [bemakkulin], as Rabbi Akiva was tortured to death by\nthe Romans. Moses said before Him: Master of the Universe, this is\nTorah and this is its reward? God said to him: Be silent; this\nintention arose before Me.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>What does it mean \"this intention arose before me\"?</p>\n<p>The <em>meforshim</em> (can't remember who, off hand) explain as follows:</p>\n<p>We learn:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Genesis.2.4?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://www.sefaria.org/Genesis.2.4?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en</a></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>אֵ֣לֶּה תוֹלְד֧וֹת הַשָּׁמַ֛יִם וְהָאָ֖רֶץ בְּהִבָּֽרְאָ֑ם בְּי֗וֹם\nעֲשׂ֛וֹת יְהוָ֥ה אֱלֹהִ֖ים אֶ֥רֶץ וְשָׁמָֽיִם׃</p>\n<p>Such is the story of heaven and earth when they were created.

It is\nto this that what is written in (Genesis 2:4) alludes — “In the day\nthat the Lord God made earth and heaven”.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This means to say that the level of strict judgement that was applied to Rabbi Akiva and his associates was the level of strict judgement that the world as a whole could never have survived, but that could be accepted by Rabbi Akiva and his associates.</p>\n<p>Hence were this level of judgement not have been able to be accepted by anyone at all the initial justification for the creation of the world would have fallen away and the world would have been destroyed.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>Now this answer is based from inference from a different story, but I nonetheless think it's quite correct.</p>\n\n<p>When דוד became king, he wanted to build the בית רשאון, however השם didn't let him. His son שלמה would do it instead. Why was this? Because דוד was such a צדיק that השם wouldn't of destroyed the בית המקדש when he was in anger, and rather he would of destroyed all of עם ישראל. Destroying the בית המקדש was a כפרה, and if that כפרה was unattainable, עם ישראל would've been destroyed in its stead.</p>\n\n<p>The same logic follows here. When the 10 צדיקים were decreed to be killed, it was a כפרה for the עולם! (The death of a צדיק atones for the sins of a generation.) without such כפרה the world would be destroyed! Therefore when all the מאלכים where praying, השם told them, if their תפילות were accepted and the 10 צדיקים kept alive, the world would be destroyed in their place!</p>\n\n<p>This was not a threat, and השם was not so angry He didn't want anyone to even pray for the צדיקים. Rather, He told the מאלכים a statement of fact: The world requires כפרה, and if they don't get it in this way, that's the end!</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>My understanding of that passage is based on what I've heard in several shiurim. When the angels pleaded before Hashem, He said 2 things:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Be quiet</li>\n<li>I'll return the world to chaos.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Each has a meaning. The first means this: \"be quiet, if you think this is tragic and are upset about it, how do you think it makes Me feel?\". I.e. don't think I don't care, I am unfeeling, or that your objection is something I even need to hear! I don't. I object to this too!</p>\n<p>Then He answers the obvious question they would ask Him next: \"if You object, why don't You stop it?\". This is the meaning of 2). In order for me to change things, I'd have to restart the entire world from scratch, which I am not going to do.</p>\n<p>Your question still stands though, as in why does it have to be that way, or why didn't He restart the world? We don't know the answers to these questions really. We struggle with them. At the end of the day, Hashem set up the world, and partnered with us in giving us free will and together we make a life for ourselves. He's not going to step in and override that, so the only option would be to just start over. He's not going to do that.</p>\n<p><strong>tl;dr:</strong> I don't think this is a decree/punishment thing <em>per se</em>. I.e. don't think this was an \"evil decree\". This was something that had to happen, was brought about for a specific reason, and the world can't do without it (without resetting the whole thing). That doesn't mean there isn't some element of punishment about it, nor that it was inevitable completely. See TheGRAPKE's answer, as well as the following, for more insight into that.</p>\n<p>For a similar case of \"starting the world over\" see this passage about <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Taanit.25a.11\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">R Elazar Ben Padat in Taanit 25a</a>, which has a more light hearted take on the matter:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>רַבִּי אֶלְעָזָר בֶּן פְּדָת דְּחִיקָא לֵיהּ מִילְּתָא טוּבָא. עֲבַד\nמִלְּתָא וְלָא הֲוָה לֵיהּ מִידֵּי לְמִטְעַם, שְׁקַל בְּרָא דְתוּמָא\nוְשַׁדְיֵיהּ בְּפוּמֵּיהּ, חֲלַשׁ לִבֵּיהּ וְנִים. אֲזוּל רַבָּנַן\nלְשַׁיּוֹלֵי בֵּיהּ, חַזְיוּהּ דְּקָא בָכֵי וְחָיֵיךְ, וּנְפַק\nצוּצִיתָא דְנוּרָא מֵאַפּוּתֵיהּ.</p>\n<p>§ The Gemara relates more stories of desperately poor righteous\nindividuals. Rabbi Elazar ben Pedat was hard-pressed for money. Once\nan act of bloodletting was performed on him, but he did not have\nanything to taste afterward. He took a clove of garlic and put it in\nhis mouth. His heart became weak and he fell asleep. The Sages came to\ninquire about his welfare. They saw him weeping and laughing, and a\nray of light was shining from his forehead.</p>\n<p>כִּי אִתְּעַר, אֲמַרוּ לֵיהּ: מַאי טַעְמָא קָבָכֵית וְחָיְיכַתְּ?\nאֲמַר לְהוּ: דַּהֲוָה יָתֵיב עִמִּי הַקָּדוֹשׁ בָּרוּךְ הוּא,\nוַאֲמַרִי לֵיהּ: עַד מָתַי אֶצְטַעַר בְּהַאי עָלְמָא? וַאֲמַר לִי:\nאֶלְעָזָר בְּנִי, נִיחָא לָךְ דְּאֵפְכֵיהּ לְעָלְמָא מֵרֵישָׁא,\nאֶפְשָׁר דְּמִתְיַלְּדַתְּ בְּשַׁעְתָּא דִמְזוֹנֵי.</p>\n<p>When he awoke they said to him: What is the reason that you were\nlaughing and crying? He said to them: The reason is that in my dream\nthe Holy One, Blessed be He, was sitting with me, and I said to Him:\nUntil when will I suffer such poverty in this world? And He said to\nme: Elazar, My son, is it more convenient for you that I return the\nworld to its very beginning? Perhaps you will be born in an hour of\nsustenance and not be poor.</p>\n<p>אֲמַרִי לְקַמֵּיהּ: כּוּלֵּי הַאי, וְאֶפְשָׁר? אֲמַרִי לֵיהּ: דַּחֲיַי\nטְפֵי אוֹ דְחָיֵינָא? אֲמַר לִי: דַּחֲיֵית. אֲמַרִי לְקַמֵּיהּ: אִם\nכֵּן, לָא בָּעֵינָא.</p>\n<p>I said before Him: You suggest doing all this, to return the world to\nits beginning, and even then is it only a possibility that things will\nbe different, not a certainty? I said to Him: Are the years that I\nhave already lived more numerous, or are that I will live more\nnumerous? He said to me: Those years that you have lived are greater.\nI said before Him: If so, I do not want You to recreate the world for\nthe sake of a brief few years.</p>\n<p>אֲמַר לִי: בְּהַאי אַגְרָא דַּאֲמַרְתְּ ״לָא בָּעֵינָא״ יָהֵיבְנָא\nלָךְ לְעָלְמָא דְּאָתֵי תְּלֵיסְרֵי נַהְרָווֹתָא דְמִשְׁחָא\nאֲפַרְסְמוֹן דָּכַיִין כִּפְרָת וְדִיגְלַת, דְּמִעַנְּגַתְּ בְּהוּ.\nאֲמַרִי לְקַמֵּיהּ: הַאי וְתוּ לָא? אֲמַר לִי: וּלְחַבְרָךְ מַאי\nיָהֵיבְנָא? אֲמַרִי לֵיהּ: וַאֲנָא מִגַּבְרָא דְּלֵית לֵיהּ בָּעֵינָא?\nמַחְיַין בְּאִסְקוּטְלָא אַפּוּתַאי, וַאֲמַר לִי: אֶלְעָזָר בְּרִי,\nגָּרוֹ בָּךְ גִּירַי.</p>\n<p>He said to me: As a reward for saying: I do not want, I will give you\nin the World-to-Come thirteen rivers of pure balsam oil as large as\nthe Euphrates and the Tigris for you to enjoy. I said before Him: This\nand no more? He said to me: But if I give you more, what will I give\nto your colleagues? I said to Him: And do I request this from a\nperson, who does not have enough? You are omnipotent. He playfully\nsnapped His finger [askutla] on my forehead and said to me: Elazar, my\nson, My arrows I cast upon you, My arrows. This touch caused the ray\nof light to shine from his forehead.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Perhaps pursuing the commentaries from here might yield some more pearls on this matter.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Why are sins and hatred mentioned in Avinu Malkeinu?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>At the end of Chazaras HaShatz on Rosh Hashanah and Yom Kippur, we say a brief prayer that (in Nusach Ashkenaz) appears as follows:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>אבינו מלכנו זכר רחמיך וכבוש כעסך וכלה דבר וחרב ורעב ושבי ומשחית <strong>ועון</strong> ומגפה ופגע רע וכל מחלה וכל תקלה וכל קטטה וכל מיני פרעניות וכל גזרה רעה <strong>ושנאת חנם</strong> מעלינו ומעל כל בני בריתך</p>\n  \n  <p>Our Father, our King, remember Your compassion and suppress Your anger, bring an end to pestilence, bloodshed, famine, captivity, destruction, <strong>iniquity</strong>, plague, evil mishap, every illness, every obstacle, every strife, every sort of punishment, every evil decree, and <strong>baseless hatred</strong> from upon us and from upon all members of Your covenant. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The main theme of the passage seems to be that G-d should have mercy on us and withhold these terrible things from\nus. Under that reading, the two boldfaced terms seem out of place: sins are dependent on the sinner (“everything is in the hands of Heaven except for fear of Heaven” - Berachos 33b), and baseless hatred is dependent on the hater (one of <em>his</em> sins). So how can we say that HaShem should withhold these from us when it’s not up to Him?</p>\n\n<p><sup>I know some of you are pointing to “everything is in the hands of Heaven except for [diseases caused by] cold [and] hot” - Kesuvos 30a - which seems to indicate that I should ask on pestilence, plague, and sickness, but that Gemara is seemingly a narrow case; most diseases are, in fact, caused by things besides temperature, as that very Gemara proceeds to discuss. However, this question <em>can</em> be asked on the similar line in the standard Avinu Malkeinu prayer, כלה דבר וחרב ורעב ושבי ומשחית <strong>ועון</strong> ושמש מבני בריתך, but for the same reason cannot be asked on the following line, מנע מגפה מנחלתיך.</sup></p>\n\n\n",

The fur is initially harvested from the pelt of a dead animal before it is made into felt.</p>\n<p>Does handling or wearing such a hat qualify as touching the corpse of a dead unclean animal, as forbidden in <a href=\"http://www.mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt0311.htm#8\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Leviticus 11:8</a>?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>I don't know what source you would accept as far as Kaaraite opinions, but there is a Sedducee/Kaaraite opinion quoted in Ibn Ezra (which he dismisses) that might shed some light on the subject. He says the Karites believed that these animals cause impurity even when alive! </p>\n\n<p>See Leviticus <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Leviticus.11.26?with=Ibn%20Ezra&lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">11 26</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Every animal that has true hoofs but without clefts through the hoofs, or that does not chew the cud.

One Sadducee [a derogatory reference to a Karaite — Translator] heretic has read this verse to mean “Whoever touches them while alive becomes ritually impure”. There is no need to answer words of lunacy. Scripture prohibited only their flesh, and specified, “do not touch their remains ” [:8].</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>There is no purifying act mentioned for these items so we can assume once impure, always impure.

This prohibition applies only to the Festivals when the people enter the Temple and have to bring karbonos. We also see from the answer to <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/71473/acceptable-to-receive-transplant-of-organs-grown-inside-pigs\">Acceptable to receive transplant of organs grown inside pigs?</a> that one is only forbidden to sell (pig as an example) that leads to it being eaten. Thus, fur for a hat is like pig skin for a football (see quote at the end of this post). Another example is <a href=\"http://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/681556/jewish/Can-I-wear-pigskin-shoes.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Can I wear pigskin shoes?</a> which also uses Rashi to show that it is allowed.</p>\n\n<p>Also we see</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Now, the above is true regarding the flesh of the animal. Animal hide,\n  however, does not carry impurities, especially when it is tanned.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>This also includes the fur. Thus there is no impurity in the hat.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.chabad.org/library/bible_cdo/aid/9912#v=8&showrashi=true\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rashi on Leviticus 11:8</a></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><strong>and you shall not touch their carcasses:</strong> One might think that Israelites are prohibited to touch a carcass. Scripture, however,\n  says, “Say to the kohanim …[(a kohen) shall not defile himself for a\n  (dead) person among his people]” (Lev. 21:1); thus, kohanim are\n  prohibited [from defiling themselves by human corpses], but ordinary\n  Israelites are not prohibited. Now a kal vachomer can be made: Since\n  in the more stringent case of defilement by a human corpse, only\n  kohanim are prohibited, then in the more lenient case of defilement by\n  animal carcasses, how much more so [should only kohanim be prohibited!\n  If so,] what does Scripture mean by, “you shall not touch their\n  carcasses”? [It means that Israelites may not touch animal carcasses]\n  on the Festivals [since at those times they deal with holy sacrifices\n  and enter the Temple]. This is what [the Sages] said: A person is\n  obligated to cleanse himself on Festivals. - [R.H. 16b, Torath Kohanim\n  11:74]</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>As an example from <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/71473/acceptable-to-receive-transplant-of-organs-grown-inside-pigs\">Acceptable to receive transplant of organs grown inside pigs?</a></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>[Rashba][1] (Responsa: 3:223) writes that there is no universal\n  prohibition to benefit from pigs; only a rabbinic injunction against\n  engaging in commerce with them.</p>\n  \n  <blockquote>\n    <p>אם החזיר מותר בהנאה, במה שהתרת ליקח אותו בחובו? חדא: שהוא בעצמו אינו אסור בהנאה, דבר תורה, ואפילו לעשות בו סחורה, אלא מדבריהם</p>\n  </blockquote>\n  \n  <hr>\n  \n  <p>According to most authorities this limit on commerce is a rabbinic injunction.

Alternatively, שילוח האם (sending the mother) matches the language from the <a href=\"http://www.mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt0522.htm#7\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Torah</a>: \"שַׁלֵּחַ תְּשַׁלַּח אֶת-הָאֵם\".</p>\n\n<p>So why is the mitzvah called shiluach haken?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 5)\n\n<p>R.

As he writes:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>והיינו דקרי למצוה זו שילוח הקן. כלומר שילוח שמתיר את הקן.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Or, \"nest\" can refer to the eggs (cf. <a href=\"https://he.m.wikisource.org/wiki/%D7%91%D7%91%D7%90_%D7%9E%D7%A6%D7%99%D7%A2%D7%90_%D7%A7%D7%91_%D7%90\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Rashi BM 102a</a>, s.v. קרי) hence the translation could be: <em>sending</em> [of the mother permitting] the <em>eggs</em>.</p>\n\n\n",

Minhag is any act that the masses, on their own, accept. According to the Rambam, to qualify as a minhag the practice must then ratified by the rabbinate. Any minhag that is against actual halakhah, is called a minhag ta’os, a mistaken minhag. Any that is based on a misunderstanding is a minhag shetus, a foolish custom. These two subtypes should not be followed. Any nearly universal minhag is called a minhag Yisrael, and has most of the stringencies of law. Yarmulka and ma’ariv services are two examples of a minhag Yisrael.</p></li>\n<li><p><strong>Taqana / Din deRabanan</strong> (a rabbinic law)- These are set up by the rabbinate, instead of the masses, in order to preserve the spirit of the law. For example, Purim and Chanukah. There are 7 new commandments that are entirely rabbinic. According to the Rambam, who only counts biblical mitzvos amongst the 613, this means there are actually 620 mitzvos altogether.</p></li>\n<li><p><strong>Gezeira deRabanan</strong> (a rabbinic “fence”)-  These are enacted to prevent a common cause for breaking the act of the law. For example, one may not place food directly on a fire before Shabbos in order to keep it heated during Shabbos. This is a fence around the law against cooking on Shabbos. To prevent the gezeira from being violated, a metal cover, called a “blech” in Yiddish, is placed on the stove top before Shabbos with the flame (turned to a low setting) under one section and the pot with food placed on the blech. This blech serves as a fence, allowing heating of the food without any danger of violating the law. Note that a “gezeira dirabanan” becomes binding only if the community accepts it. According to the Rambam, a gezeira cannot be overturned. However, a gezeirah where the law’s purpose is included in the legislation is implicitly conditional on the purpose. The problem is in knowing when the purpose is given in the quoted gezeirah, and when the gemara provides a motivation on its own, after quoting the gezeirah. For example, meat must be salted within three days of slaughter, or the prohibited blood will be too soaked into the meat to be retrieved. What about the contemporary situation, where meat is generally frozen solid? Some rule that since the reason is given in the legislation, and the reason doesn’t apply, neither does the time limit. Others rule stringently, presumably because they do not believe the reasoning about the blood being soaked into the meat was part of the legislation as initially codified.</p>\n\n<p>According to the Tif’eres Yisrael (Ediyos 1), there are actually two sub-categories:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Siyag</strong> (\"fence\" in Hebrew; “gezeirah” is Aramaic)- Something that will lead to a future violation to do an error in understanding the law. Such as the ban on mixing poultry and milk, lest people become lenient in mixing meat and milk.</li>\n<li><strong>Cheshash</strong> (concern)- Cases where the threat of violation is in the current situation, because one is in a circumstance where habit taking over or other accident is likely.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>The Tif’eres Yisrael says that a cheshash can be deemed inapplicable if the norms change such that the threat no longer exists. It does not require a beis din that is greater in number or wisdom as the law is not lifted, just that the current situation is deemed to be outside the limits the law addressed.</p></li>\n<li><p><strong>Asmachta</strong> (mnemonic)- The Raavad (on Mamrim 2) considers laws backed by a mnemonic in the Torah are in a different category than other rabbinic laws. He writes that Hashem wrote these asmachtos as a way to suggest laws to us to enact as needed.</p></li>\n<li><p><strong>Divrei Qabbalah</strong> (the words that were received)- i.e. laws enacted by a beis din like the Great Assembly that included nevi’im (prophets). Many consider these rabbinic laws one step closer to Torahitic law than most others, since the law was ratified by consulting with Hashem Himself. This is like the Raavad’s concept of asmachta, but more so — not only suggested by Hashem to be used as needed, but we’re told that the situation justified it.Those who believe this is a distinct category would include Purim as divrei Soferim rather than usual rabbinic law. Some achronim rule that the obligation for women must hear megillah and the other mitzvos of Purim is rabbinic but for men it’s divrei qabbalah. Thus, their obligation is lesser.</p></li>\n<li><p><strong>Pesaq</strong> (a rabbinic ruling)- This ruling addresses a the questionable area of some law or custom. A pesaq that is not prima facie in violation of accepted halakhah can only be overruled by another body that is both larger in number (or perhaps number of students), and greater in “chokhmah”. (The ability to know how to use the facts. Not more knowledgeable book-wise, but more steeped in the Torah weltanschauung.)</p></li>\n<li><p><strong>Derashah</strong> (a law derived by hermeneutics)- Some hold that derashah only serves as support for already known laws, and therefore are tools in pesaq. However others, including the Rambam, see them as constructive, a means for discovering new Torahitic laws. This appears to be supported by a medrash on Rus, in which Boaz is credited as being the first to rule that “Moavi” means males from Moav in particular.</p></li>\n<li><p>A last category has only two examples, and they are related. Torah law mandates a shevus, a law to rest on Shabbos. It also requires resting from some of the melachos, constructive work activities, even on chol hamo’ed. However, Hashem left it up to man to decide the parameters of these forms of rest.</p></li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>You asked about the practical disinction between the second and third categories; it is subtle. In order to be a taqana (a din, or issur, or melakhah deRabanan), the prohibited action is one that is similar in purpose to the permitted one.</p>\n\n<p>In contrast, a gezeira does not even require an action. In the example I gave, it was inaction, leaving the pot where it is, that is prohibited. Second, the category includes things that are similar in means to the prohibited act, and will therefore cause confusion about what is and what isn’t okay; and things which will allow people to be caught up in habit, and forget about the prohibition. Only a gezeira may defy an actual Divine law (although a pesaq will often define one), and even so only under specific circumstances. All of the following must be satisfied:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>The law being protected is more stringent than the one being violated. This determination isn’t easy.</li>\n<li>The law is being violated only through inaction. No one is being told to actively violate G-d’s commandment.</li>\n<li>According to the Ta”z, the law being violated will still be applicable in most situations. It still must exist in some form. (Not every acharon agrees with this requirement.)</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>In another way, a gezeira is less powerful than a regular taqana in that it cannot be compounded. One may not make a “fence” for the express purpose of protecting another “fence”.</p>\n\n<p>A law is considered accepted if it becomes common practice. Any taqana or gezeira that does not get accepted by the masses in the short run, does not become binding in the long run. Similarly, there are rules for pesaq, but they are violated if the masses choose to follows some other rabbinic body’s pesaq. Notice, however, that this need for acceptance is only in the short run, to enact the law. Once a law is accepted, it may only be overruled by pesaq. It does not cease to exist just because it faded out of practice.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>Succinctly put, in the words of Prof. <a href=\"http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9907E5DC123AF93BA2575AC0A9629D8B63\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Dov Zlotnick</a> (<a href=\"https://g.co/kgs/5ooy2J\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">The Iron Pillar</a>, 116ff.): </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>If the purpose of the gezerah in most cases was to forbid something around that was essentially permitted in order to put a fence around the law, that of the takkanah was to make an enactment, a \"repair\", if you will, insuring the very structure of the law. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Foot_Moore\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">G.F.

(2) Even though some commentators do take it that way (e.g., Halichot Olam), we aren't going to mess with the text based on a safek, especially if it's a minority view. (3) Even if the gemara means the mishnah's text is mistaken, the correcting of the mishnah is part of the give and take of the Talmud. Including it is similar to the inclusion of rejected opinions, rejected hava aminas, misunderstood opinions, even other kinds of corrections (\"if it was said, it was said like this\" or \"this is what I meant\"). Rashi does sometimes give a heads-up on the Mishnah that the gemara is going to mess with the girsa. Though this third explanation may not explain why we don't make the corrections in printed collections of the Mishnah separate from the Talmud assuming such editions serve an independent, non-talmud-related purpose.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Can a Gentile Convert to Judaism AFTER the Coming of the Moshiach?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>As a non-Jew, I have been wondering whether or not it would be better for me to convert to Judaism or to keep the <a href=\"https://asknoah.org/7-commandments/locate-sources\" rel=\"noreferrer\">seven mitzvot</a>. This decision is a difficult one for me. On the one hand, I can remain a Noachide, keep the seven commandments, and have a share in the World to Come, or, I can convert, keep the 613 commandments, and have a share in the World to Come. So what's the problem? Why not just remain a Noachide and enjoy an easier life with less responsibilities and still have a share in the World to Come!? The problem is that I want to be closer to HaShem. Both are meaningful, but I think that the second option would be much more meaningful than the first. (However, I don't think G-d would approve my conversion yet since I am still struggling with my yezter hara.) Thankfully I am still young (almost 30 y/o) and have plenty of time and will continue to study Torah every day. </p>\n\n<p>The question I have is a simple one and it's been on my mind for a while now. If the Moshiach comes and I haven't converted yet, would it be too late at that point? And will I forever remain a Noachide? </p>\n\n<p>I look forward to your answers!  </p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 6)\n\n<p>According to the Talmud (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Yevamot.24b.8?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Yevamoth 24b</a>), <em>geruth</em> (conversion) will no longer be performed in the messianic era:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>ת\"ר: אין מקבלין גרים לימות המשיח. כיוצא בו לא קבלו גרים לא בימי דוד ולא בימי שלמה. א\"ר אליעזר: מאי קרא: (ישעיהו נד, טו) הן גור יגור אפס מאותי מי גר אתך עליך יפול </p>\n  \n  <p>The Sages taught: Conversion is not performed in the days of the Messiah. Similarly, they did not perform conversions in the days of King David or in the days of King Solomon. Rabbi Eliezer said: What is the verse that hints at this halakha? “Behold, they may gather together [<em>gor yagur</em>], but without Me; whosoever shall gather together [<em>gar</em>] with you shall fall on yours” (Isaiah 54:15). </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Maimonides (<em>Issurei Biah</em> 13:15) seems to interpret this passage as focused on the strict filters in place for discerning ulterior motives:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>שהמצוה הנכונה כשיבא הגר או הגיורת להתגייר בודקין אחריו שמא בגלל ממון שיטול או בשביל שררה שיזכה לה או מפני הפחד בא להכנס לדת. ואם איש הוא בודקין אחריו שמא עיניו נתן באשה יהודית. ואם אשה היא בודקין שמא עיניה נתנה בבחור מבחורי ישראל. אם לא נמצא להם עילה, מודיעין אותן כובד עול התורה וטורח שיש בעשייתה על עמי הארצות כדי שיפרושו. אם קבלו ולא פירשו וראו אותן שחזרו מאהבה, מקבלים אותן שנאמר: ותרא כי מתאמצת היא ללכת אתה ותחדל לדבר אליה</p>\n  \n  <p>לפיכך לא קבלו בית דין גרים כל ימי דוד ושלמה - בימי דוד שמא מן הפחד חזרו, ובימי שלמה שמא בשביל המלכות והטובה והגדולה שהיו בה ישראל חזרו שכל החוזר מן העכו\"ם בשביל דבר מהבלי העולם אינו מגירי הצדק. ואעפ\"כ היו גרים הרבה מתגיירים בימי דוד ושלמה בפני הדיוטות. והיו ב\"ד הגדול חוששין להם - לא דוחין אותן אחר שטבלו מכ\"מ ולא מקרבין אותן עד שתראה אחריתם</p>\n  \n  <p>...the proper way of performing the mitzvah is when a male or a female prospective convert comes, we inspect his motives for conversion. Perhaps he is coming for the sake of financial gain, in order to receive a position of authority, or he desires to enter our faith because of fear. For a man, we check whether he focused his attention on a Jewish woman. For a woman, we check whether she focused her attention on a Jewish youth.</p>\n  \n  <p>If we find no ulterior motive, we inform them of the heaviness of the yoke of the Torah and the difficulty the common people have in observing it so that they will abandon [their desire]. If they accept [this introduction] and do not abandon their resolve and thus we see that they are motivated by love, we accept them, as [indicated by Ruth 1:18]: \"And she saw that she was exerting herself to continue with her and she ceased speaking with her.\"</p>\n  \n  <p>...For this reason, the court did not accept converts throughout the reign of David and Solomon. In David's time, [they feared] that they sought to convert because of fear and in Solomon's time, [they feared] that they were motivated by the sovereignty, prosperity, and eminence which Israel enjoyed. [They refrained from accepting such converts, because] a gentile who seeks to convert because of the vanities of this [material] world is not a righteous convert.</p>\n  \n  <p>Nevertheless, there were many people who converted in the presence of ordinary people during the era of David and Solomon. The Supreme Sanhedrin would view them with skepticism. Since they immersed themselves, they would not reject them, but they would not draw them close until they saw what the outcome would be.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>I personally converted and found that claim that it would be closed after moshiach is king definitely motivated me to hurry and get it to happen. BH I made it. With that said, nothing will happen until every meant to be convert has been converted so put your mind at ease and think good and it will be good!</p>\n\n\n",

The first festival in Tishri is Rosh HaShanah, the first one in Nisan is Pesach. Also both of these start a 'new year' in their own way as Tishri Marks the head of a year, and Nisan Marks the head of the months (many commentators explain the reason for this). </p>\n\n<p>But on a more spiritual level what does one learns from both of these half-year cycles comparing them to eachother?. What do these cycles try to tell us?</p>\n\n<p>P.s. And what can one learn if one would take these cycles as whole-year cycles:\nSo if we take the whole year from Tishri to Tishri v.s. all the months from Nisan to Nisan as two ways of looking at a religious/spiritual year - full of moadim - in stead of half year cycles, and take the order of Vayikra 23 as a basis for the full year cycle starting with Nisan, and would take this same order but instead - in the case of a Tishri cycle - would start off with Rosh HaShanah (instead of Pesach) and after it follow all the other moadim described after their order in time, and would compare such cycles.. what would they tell/teach us?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>I am not sure if these are the two cycles to which you refer, but Rav Aharon Feldman shared a beautiful thought about the two cycles \n1) Pesach, Shavuos, and Sukkos. \n2) Rosh Hashona, Yom Kippur, Sukkos.\n Pesach is when the Jewish people were appointed by G-d as messenger. Shavuos is when we fulfilled our <em>shlichus</em> by receiving the Torah. And Sukkos is when we returned and said \"We have fulfilled our mission.\" Unfortunately we sinned (with the Golden Calf) and nearly did not fulfill our mission. Therefore we needed Yom Kippur before we could have celebrate sukkos.</p>\n\n\n",

He explains that it asks for a hint that references him before he came:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>ועוד זה שאלו ממנו - מנין למשה רמז קודם שבא שסופו לבא</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>This is clearly the understanding of the <a href=\"https://he.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D7%99%D7%A2%D7%A7%D7%91_%D7%A1%D7%A7%D7%99%D7%9C%D7%99\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Torat HaMinha</a> (Parashat Shemot: derasha 20 p. 176) as well:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>ומששת ימי בראשית היתה נפשו של משה רבינו ע\"ה מזומנת לבוא ולפרנס לישראל בגלות מצרים, וכמו שאמרו (חולין קלט ב) מנין למשה מן התורה דכתיב בשגם הוא בשר והיו ימיו מאה ועשרים שנה, בשגם בגמטריה משה, ורצו לומר שקודם שבא לעולם כבר היה מזומן ומוכן לבוא </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Additionally as Rashi notes, the cited verse contains the phrase: \"And Man's day's will be 120 years\", an allusion to Moshe who lived to be 120:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>וכתיב שם והיו ימיו מאה ועשרים שנה וכך היו ימי חיי משה כלומר עתיד לבא בשגם משה מן הנולדים וכן ימיו </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The Torat HaMinha also quotes the part of the verse about 120 years.

Indeed, the text of Ms. Oxford - Bodl. heb. c. 21 (2666) 23 includes the line והיו ימיו מאה ועשרים שנה.</p>\n\n<p>Maharsha explains that the question was how we know that Moshe is his \"primary name\". The answer is that since the Torah alludes to him with this name, that that is his real name. Maharsha does not indicate that there is any deeper connection between him and the verse.

It says explicitly that Jane could get a divorce from Bob and then go and marry Joe. (She could not, however, subsequently divorce Joe and re-marry Bob; alternatively, if she was still married to Bob and cheated on him with Joe, then got a divorce, she may not marry Joe now. While both of those are prohibited, neither is \"adultery\" per se. But all of this is far beyond the scope of your question.) <strong>Thus, it would never be \"adultery\" for a woman to first get divorced from one man, then go meet and marry some other man.</strong> </p>\n\n<p>Judaism makes it clear that divorce is allowed, for all sorts of reasons -- <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Mishnah_Gittin.9?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">see Mishna Gittin 9:10</a>, though just because it's allowed doesn't mean it's always the morally best thing to do. Sometimes, though, a couple is absolutely, fundamentally, <em>what-were-they-thinking</em> incompatible; <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hershel_Schachter\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">one contemporary senior rabbinic authority</a> tells that a mentor of his declared that a congratulatory toast is in order upon handling such a couple's divorce!</p>\n\n<p>If a non-Jew chooses to identify with Judaism and study it, that's great, but a formal conversion ritual requires quite a few steps, the very first one is to go discuss the situation with a rabbi. Until there is a formal conversion, such a person would be considered non-Jewish -- despite all their good intentions -- and thus, a Jewish person would be prohibited from marrying them.</p>\n\n<p>Some people unhappy with their non-Jewish faiths instead identify as <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noahidism\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Noahide</a> -- i.e. they do and keep everything that Judaism expects non-Jews to keep, which does not require a conversion.</p>\n\n<p>I hope this background information is helpful as you determine your path forward.</p>\n\n\n",

If both are valid, what are the sources or reasons for addition vs. substitution?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 6)\n\n<p>The \"add\" option is certainly not immediately intuitive, since there's a clear duplication of the phrase \"you have graced אתה חונן\". It seems reasonable to expect that אתה חוננתנו was composed as a replacement for אתה חונן which includes the Havdalah parts. It's quite common in fact to see Piyutim composed as replacements for certain blessings over time ending up being printed in addition to the original wording, probably due to opposition (either rabbinic or communal) to abandoning the original wording.</p>\n\n<p>There's actually a third option you don't mention for how to include Havdalah in this blessing which is to open with the ordinary אתה חונן line and then jump straight into the Havdalah portion without the extraneous opening line from אתה חוננתנו. An example of such an option is found in the <a href=\"http://mechon-mamre.org/i/2700.htm#18\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Rambam's Siddur</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>אתה חונן לאדם דעת, ומלמד לאנוש בינה, ואתה הבדלת בין קודש לחול, ובין אור לחושך... וחוננו מאיתך דעה ובינה והשכל.  ברוך אתה ה', חונן הדעת.‏ </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Let's call the Koren-type option '1', the Rambam-type option '2', and Artscroll-type option '3'.</p>\n\n<p>The Beit Yosef (<a href=\"https://he.wikisource.org/wiki/%D7%98%D7%95%D7%A8_%D7%90%D7%95%D7%A8%D7%97_%D7%97%D7%99%D7%99%D7%9D_%D7%A8%D7%A6%D7%93\" rel=\"noreferrer\">OC 294</a>) quotes the Orchot Chayim that you should not follow Option 1 since that would be changing the text of blessings improperly and instead you should follow Option 2 as found in the Siddurim of the Rambam and Rav Amram Gaon. But the Beit Yosef notes the custom is to follow Option 1 since it's essentially the same content and therefore isn't a problematic change. (Note none of them even consider Option 3.)</p>\n\n<p>The Darkei Moshe there quotes opinions that Option 3 is indeed just a mistake and one should either follow Option 1 or 2. The Maharshal too cites these opinions.</p>\n\n<p>But many later authorities felt that Option 3 was the custom and work to defend it. The Bach there says it's not a duplicate request since the first is referring to general knowledge (which God grants all of mankind חונן לאדם) and the latter refers to spiritual knowledge (which God only grants \"us\" חוננתנו). The Levush <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=14585&st=&pgnum=29\" rel=\"noreferrer\">there</a> writes along similar lines, and even argues for saying \"וחננו...‏\" twice, once for each type of knowledge. The Taz too defends Option 3 for Ashkenazim who <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/a/82490/759\">understand \"adding\" in the context of requests for rain to similarly be strictly additive</a>.</p>\n\n<p>The Perisha defends Option 1, but the Magen Avraham says the custom is to follow Option 3.</p>\n\n<p>So in your case it sounds like Artscroll is following the controversial \"longstanding\" custom, while Koren is accepting the old critiques and reverting to what appears to have been the \"original\" practice.</p>\n\n<p>(I note the Mishnah Berura (294 sk 2) rules that, at least after the fact, one who followed either option has fulfilled his obligation.)</p>\n\n\n",

Rashi there elaborates:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><strong>מזווגין אשה לפי מעשיו</strong> - צנועה לצדיק ופרוצה לרשע:</p>\n  \n  <p><strong>We pair for him a woman according to his actions</strong> - A modest woman for a righteous man and an immodest woman for a wicked man</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Why does Rashi have to say this? Why can’t he say צדקת לצדיק ורשיעה לרשע - a righteous woman for a righteous man and a wicked woman for a wicked man? </p>\n\n<p>Further, doesn’t a righteous woman automatically assume a modest one, and the opposite for a wicked woman? If that’s the case, then there’s no reason for Rashi to indicate the modesty of a woman when indicating her level of righteousness already tells us that. </p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>It seems that Rashi is likely following Hazal who do sometimes refer to women as צדקניות (e.g. Sotah 11b, 12a, Bava Batra 119b), but nevertheless frequently use the term צנועות  \"modest\" to refer to righteous women, even when seemingly not discussing matters of modesty. See Nidda (2:1) and Nidda (12a) which describes \"tsnuot\" who do extra bedikot. See also Ketubot (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Ketubot.2b.14?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">2b-3a</a>, 3b), where is seems that tsnuot and p'rutsot are used to refer to righteous women, and those who are not righteous, respectively.</p>\n\n<p>Importantly, although they use the plural term צדקניות, I am not aware of the singular ever being used anywhere in Hazal! It is unsurprising that Rashi doesn't make up a word to use in context. </p>\n\n<p>Why the language may have developed this way is probably not knowable, but perhaps it has to do with a perception of the archetypal righteous female excelling at modesty. Indeed, Hazal frequently praise women for this trait (e.g. Megillah 10b, Sotah 10b, Bava Metsia 87a, B'reshit Rabba 18:2).</p>\n\n<p>Importantly, as @ShmuelBrin notes, the term צנועים is also used to refer to righteous people outside of the context of modesty, even where there is no indication that they are female, as in Kilayim (9:5), who are careful not to wear a garment with kilayim even just to display it to customers. The Rishonim there explain the term in terms unrelated to modesty. For example, Ri ben Malkitsedek renders it כשרין; proper people, Rambam (old translation) renders it מדקדקין; those who are careful, Rash MiShants (followed by Rosh and Bartenura) renders it המחמירין; those who are stringent.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>Your summary is based on the conclusion of the gemara there, as you state.

The implication is that he was saying, if one's wife was a sotah (or perhaps even a suspected one) who was hanging out with other men, it is the husband's own darn fault.</p>\n<p>In this context, Rashi correctly writes:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>מזווגין אשה לפי מעשיו - צנועה לצדיק ופרוצה לרשע:</p>\n<p>\"A man's wife is matched in accordance with his deeds\" — A modest woman for a righteous man, a promiscuous woman for an evil man.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>It is a promiscuous wife, vs. a non-promiscuous wife, that Resh Lakish was referring to by opening the discussion of Sotah with this. Wicked or righteous in general does not capture Resh Lakish's intent.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: -1)\n\n<p>Gemora in Gittin 45a answers your question, don't repeat this to your wife.</p>\n\n<p>Shlomo hamelech married a 1000 wives and testified that he did not find even 1 of them a Tzadekes in Koheles 7,28.</p>\n\n<p>בנתיה דרב נחמן בחשן קדרא בידייהו קשיא ליה לרב עיליש כתיב (קהלת ז, כח) אדם אחד מאלף מצאתי ואשה בכל אלה לא מצאתי הא איכא בנתיה דרב נחמן גרמא להו מילתא ואשתביין ואישתבאי איהו נמי בהדייהו\n§ The Gemara relates that Rav Naḥman’s daughters would stir a boiling pot with their bare hands, and people thought that the heat did not harm them due to their righteousness. Rav Ilish had a difficulty with a verse, as it is written: “A man one of a thousand I have found, and a woman among all those have I not found” (Ecclesiastes 7:28). Aren’t there Rav Naḥman’s daughters, who were exceptionally righteous? These words caused them to be taken captive, due to the evil eye, and Rav Ilish was also taken captive with them.</p>\n\n<p>He was about to escape and......</p>\n\n<p>אמר איזיל אחזי בנתיה דרב נחמן אי קיימן בהימנותייהו אהדרינהו\n Rav Ilish said: Before I leave, I will go and I will see Rav Naḥman’s daughters. If they remained steadfast in their faith and are acting appropriately, then I will take them with me and I will return them to their home.</p>\n\n<p>אמר נשי כל מילי דאית להו סדרן להדדי בבית הכסא שמעינהו דקאמרן עדי גוברין ונהרדעי גוברין לימא להו לשבוייהו דלירחקינהו מהכא דלא ליתו אינשין ולישמעי וליפרקינן\nHe said: Women tell all of their secret matters to each other in the bathroom, so he went there to eavesdrop on them. He heard them saying: These captors are now our husbands, and the men of Neharde’a to whom we are married are our husbands. We should tell our captors to distance us from here so that our husbands should not come to this area and hear that we are here, and redeem us, and take us home. They preferred to remain with their captors.</p>\n\n<p>קם ערק אתא איהו וההוא גברא לדידיה איתרחיש ליה ניסא עבר במברא וההוא גברא אשכחוה וקטלוה כי הדרן ואתן אמר הוו קא בחשן קידרא בכשפים:\nUpon hearing this Rav Ilish arose and escaped. He and that man who knew the language of the birds came to a river crossing. A miracle happened for him and he crossed the river on a ferry, and the captors found that man and killed him. When Rav Naḥman’s daughters were returned and they came back from their captivity, Rav Ilish said: They would stir the pot with witchcraft, and that is why they were not burned by the boiling pot, but it was not due to their righteousness.</p>\n\n<p>Basically a man tzaddik is much more common than a woman tzaddik so rashi statistically cannot pair up every righeous man with a righeous woman so second best is a modest women. </p>\n\n\n",

The Canaanites were said to have practiced child sacrifice as part of their practices. </p>\n\n<h2><strong>Say that a Jew had been taken hostage by the Canaanites or similar and they were planning on sacrificing him to their deities.</strong></h2>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>Would a Jew be doing the better thing if he killed himself in order to not allow his death honor a god that wasn't Hashem? </p></li>\n<li><p>Or would his sacrifice ultimately not matter because there are no gods but Hashem. Thus attempting to prevent the sacrifice is partially you acknowledging another god that isn't Hashem?</p></li>\n<li><p>The problem is I don't believe that logical train of thought is correct because we purposely create Mevushal wine in order to prevent such sacrifices from taking place. So then the sacrifice obviously would matter at some level, wouldn't it?</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>It's a complex question because I'm trying to figure out if this would fall under a similar category as being forced to worship gods that weren't Hashem. </p>\n\n<p>Jewish tradition establishes that Jews who died as martyrs died having done Kiddush Hashem. My question is would the act of committing suicide to prevent your death worshipping a foreign diety be considered a form of Kiddush Hashem?</p>\n\n<p><strong>Obviously, there's a moral complication here in that you'd be committing a gross act of sin through suicide.</strong> That being said, is the context of your sinful action understood as being an act of loyalty since you are preventing your death from honoring another diety? </p>\n\n<p>I was curious what your thoughts on this would be. </p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: -1)\n\n<p>Preventing a non jew from doing idolatry would not be a sufficient reason to be ovar on suicide.  It doesn't just become a meritorious act just because one means well.</p>\n<p>If it would be a chillul hashem when they sacrifice him for the avodah zarah, (which practically speaking will be impossible that's generally a kiddush hashem) that can be a different question.\nThe 3 cardinal sins only require one give up their life if it's his potential transgression. In your case being the sacrificial offering is not his transgression as the \"avodah\" is for them to kill someone for their idol. (If the service was to die for it, he should certainly kill himself prior to avoid a cardinal sin)</p>\n<p>While there is a concept of it being a merit to be a Korban, like by Abraham and Isaac that's not the service itself. It would be the same here although it may \"feel\" wrong there is no transgression of idolatry on his part. Idolotry or chillul hashem would be the only bases to entertain such a question, and there isn't any problem of it here.</p>\n\n\n",

We all have different levels of Jewish observance. My mom and I attend Chabad services of which a Minyan is very important.  My sister attended services today for Sukkot and Shabbat and we did not have a Minyan. I have been saying Mourner's Kaddish for my grandmother (she does not have living children) and I asked about saying the Mourner's Kaddish for her today.  I was told that we can't say the Mourner's Kaddish because we don't have a Minyan present.  We had 6 men present.  </p>\n\n<p>My sister then argued and asked \"why do we need 10? We have more than 1.  It seems arbitrary to have to require 10.\"</p>\n\n<p>We searched online and found the significance of the number 10 but that doesn't answer my sisters question.  My sister's argument is essentially we are willing and 'able' to do the prayer so why not do it?  Wouldn't doing the prayer be better than not doing the prayer regardless of the number present?  I understand certain reasons why one doesn't do prayers alone but we are asking in the case of praying in public with more than 1 person but less than 10 present.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 10)\n\n<p>The public requirement for certain prayers is based on <a href=\"http://www.mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt0322.htm#32\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Vayikra 22:32</a>: \"I will be hallowed (ונקדשתי) among the children of Israel\".

May your grandmothers soul be elevated close to G-d in the eternal bond of life & i hope this information deepens your appreciation for 'Minyan' (praying with ten men) & eases the frustration of not being able to say 'kadish' for her.

Abraham keeps asking for a lower number and 10 is the lowest number at which G-d will not destroy the city.</p>\n<p>As stated by others, the words and hearts of 10 spies (Numbers 13-14) that gave a bad report, ended up swaying the people in fear and caused 40 years of wandering in the desert.</p>\n<p>Therefore it can be seen that having a quorum of 10 men is important to making major decisions and or declarations.</p>\n<p>Because Jewish Prayer is personal, corporate, and can often be seen as pleading before G-d the Great Judge (see Rosh Hashannah and/or Yom Kippur Machzor(s)) therefore it is important in Jewish Tradition to have these judicious elements.</p>\n\n\n",

Even someone who missed praying in a minyan\n  has a mitzvah to pray in the synagogue, since it is a permanent and\n  special place of holiness in where prayer is more accepted (Shulchan\n  Aruch 90:9).</p>\n  \n  <p>However, when the minyan is held in a different place, it is\n  preferable to pray with the minyan rather than individually in the\n  synagogue. <strong>If there is a small minyan in the synagogue and a larger\n  minyan elsewhere, although there is merit to praying in the company of\n  many, the value of praying in a synagogue is greater (Pri Megadim;\n  Mishnah Berurah 90:27-28)</strong>.</p>\n  \n  <p>Every community has an obligation to fulfill the mitzvah of building a\n  synagogue which will be their mini-sanctuary (mikdash me’at) and where\n  people can pray in a minyan. As it is written (Ezekiel 11:16), “I have\n  been for them a small sanctuary,” and Rabbi Yitzchak interpreted,\n  “These are synagogues and study halls” (Megillah 29a).</p>\n  \n  <p>Reish Lakish says whoever has a synagogue in his city and does not\n  pray there is called a bad neighbor. Moreover, he brings exile upon\n  himself and his descendants. Those who arrive early to synagogue to\n  recite Shacharit and are late to leave after praying Ma’ariv merit\n  long life (Berachot 8a; Shulchan Aruch 90:11).</p>\n  \n  <p>It is a mitzvah to run to synagogue just as it is a mitzvah to run to\n  perform every mitzvah, in order to express one’s passion for matters\n  of sanctity, as it says (Hosea 6:3), “We will race on in order to know\n  Hashem.” Likewise, when one leaves the synagogue, he should walk\n  slowly, so that he not appear happy to leave the synagogue (Shulchan\n  Aruch 90:12).</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>PS. On the definition of a synagogue, I think most people would understood as a fixed place of assembly for prayer where a sefer Torah resides in permanence. Not sure the definition matters so much although I have seen fixed places of assembly without sefer Torah (for instance, for a place used only for <em>mincha/maariv</em>)</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>This question is (kind of) directly addressed by the Talmud:</p>\n\n<p><strong><a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/shas.aspx?mesechta=1&daf=6&format=pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Berachos 6a</a></strong></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>תניא אבא בנימין אומר אין תפלה של אדם נשמעת אלא בבית הכנסת שנאמר לשמוע\n  אל הרנה ואל התפלה במקום רנה שם תהא תפלה</p>\n  \n  <p>It has been taught: Abba Benjamin says: A man's prayer is heard [by\n  God] only in the Synagogue.

(<a href=\"https://halakhah.com/pdf/zeraim/Berachoth.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Soncino translation</a>)</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>This passage states clearly that a synagogue is the preferred place of prayer, and it also tells us why. The question that remains is simply how to define the \"place of song\" (מקום רנה).</p>\n\n<p>Rashi says that the \"place of song\" is the synagogue, for that is where the congregation says the songs and praises in a pleasant voice:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>במקום רנה. בבהכ\"נ ששם אומרים הצבור שירות ותשבחות בנעימת קול ערב</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Presumably, an office where you are just grabbing a quick Minchah is not a place where the congregation says the songs and praises in a pleasant voice, or at least not to the same level as a regular synagogue.</p>\n\n\n",

(Note: Most Sephardim don't read Kohelet on Sukkot.)</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>There is an explanation of the meaning of simcha that is appropriate to Kohelles. Kohelles - the wisest of men – explains in vivid detail, that all of the temporal pleasures and enjoyments of this world are vanity and futility. When all is said and done, it is only Fear and Love of Hashem and fulfillment of His Will that grants a sense of inner joy and purpose. And therein lies the message of Succos. Kohelles is not a <em>counterweight</em>, it is an explanation of what actually causes simcha.</p>\n\n<p>Malbim explains that simcha refers to internal gladness which is continual, while sasson is the external expression of one's inner happiness. In other words, sasson denotes what a person does to show that he is happy, for example wearing special clothes for holidays or playing music at happy times, while simcha is the happy feeling inside of him. Thus, Kohelles teaches us that only recognizing that only following Hashem leads to simcha.</p>\n\n<p>Chabad points out that succos is also <em>chag ha-asif</em>, the festival of the harvest. This can lead to complacency and an attempt to find <em>simcha</em> in the results of the harvest (whether it be good or better) which is olam hazeh. Kohelles reminds us that everything is from Hashem, and that is the only <strong>lasting</strong> simcha.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.chabad.org/holidays/JewishNewYear/template_cdo/aid/1310570/jewish/Why-Do-We-Read-Kohelet-on-Sukkot.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Why Do We Read Kohelet on Sukkot?</a></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>A major theme of Kohelet is the futility of mundane pursuits and\n  pleasures, and the search for deeper meaning to life. Sukkot is also\n  known as Chag ha-Asif—the Festival of Ingathering. It’s the time of\n  year when the harvest has ended, and the crops are gathered and stored\n  for the coming year. It’s a moment of great satisfaction, as one can\n  see the fruits of his labor before him.</p>\n  \n  <p>Kohelet shakes our contentment with the reminder that mundane\n  accomplishments are fleeting and empty. Even at the close of the\n  harvest, we must seek real achievement and fulfillment.</p>\n  \n  <p>Sukkot itself demonstrates this theme by the commandment to live in\n  temporary dwellings. We move outside our home, which provides a sense\n  of permanence and comfort, and instead dwell in a flimsy hut. This\n  recalls the transience of physicality, as does the book of Kohelet.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>There are also a number of answers at <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/10746/why-do-we-read-kohelet-on-sukkos\">Why do we read Kohelet on Sukkos?</a> which use this theme to point out the connection of <em>succos</em> and <em>Kohelles</em></p>\n\n\n",

I'm not sure.)</p>\n\n<p>In the <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/56211/what-is-ya-aleh-v-yavo\">Ya'aleh</a> <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/37424/what-is-yaaleh-veyavo-about\">V'yavo</a> prayer, there is an opening string of verbs. Based on what I recall of Hebrew grammar, each is written in the (gender neutral masculine) third person (\"He\" or \"it\"), singular, future tense: \"It should rise, it should come, it should arrive\" etc. These verbs should have an object -- a singular noun which would be what the pronoun \"he\" or \"it\" replaces.</p>\n\n<p>After this list there is the phrase \"zichroneinu ufikdoneinu\" (rendered as \"the remembrance and recollection of us,\" <a href=\"http://www.chabad.org/media/pdf/92404.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a>). There are then 4 other \"remembrances.\" The object of \"it should rise\" is then plural (either the \"remembrance AND recollection\" or that grouping plus the other 4 groupings) . Shouldn't the text then read \"ya'alu, v'yavo'u\" etc?</p>\n\n<p>The Artscroll siddur avoids this by translating presuming that \"ya'aleh\" means \"may there rise\" which creates the numberless concept of a \"rising\" which would then include multiple elements. Wouldn't that be better written as \"yihiyeh aliyat, uvo'at...zichroneinu ufikdoneinu\"?</p>\n\n<p>Is there some explanation that has all 5 of the \"remembrances\" as one collective \"remembrance\" or is there a way of understanding the prayer that has the verbs, though written in the singular, allowing plural nouns?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>I would suggest that there is an implied repetition of the verbs before each of the subsequent Zichronot (ie Ya'aleh...V'Yizacher Zichron Avoteinu, Ya'aleh...V'Yizacher Zichron Mashaich ben David Avdecha etc). Perhaps the reason that the verbs aren't in the plural, is that the core of the prayer is for Zichroneinu-uFikdoneinu - our rememberance, with the requests for the other rememberances, Jerusalem, the Mashiach etc, being secondary. Consistent with this is that the second half of the prayer starting from Zochreinu, is specifically for \"us\".</p>\n\n<p>One possible analogy to this is in Psalm 136, where I think there is the implied word \"Hodu\" (which appears explicitly - followed by \"Le...\" - in the first 3 verses and the last verse) at the start of the verses starting with \"Le...\".</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# The testimony of former minors - a question on Ketubot 28a\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>The Mishna (Ketubot 2:10, 28a) states that there are certain people who are trusted to deliver testimony that relates to something that they witnessed as minors. Included within that list are those who testify concerning the handwriting of their father, their rabbi and their brother.</p>\n\n<p>The gemara (Ketubot 28a) asks why it is necessary to teach all three (father, rabbi, brother), and resolves that if it only mentioned one's father we would not be able to deduce one's rabbi, that if it only mentioned one's rabbi we would not be able to deduce one's father, and that even if it mentioned one's father <em>and</em> one's rabbi we would still not be able to deduce one's brother.</p>\n\n<p>The problem is that, while one's father and one's brother have aspects to them that mean they need to be taught independently of one another, that which allows one to testify concerning his brother's handwriting should go for the other two as well!</p>\n\n<p>Specifically, the reason that one can be trusted to recognise his father's handwriting is that he was commonly found around his father as a child, which is not the case with one's rabbi, and the reason that he is trusted to recognise his rabbi's handwriting is that he was in awe of him, which is not the case with one's father. But the reason that he is trusted to recognise his <em>brother's</em> handwriting is that testifying to somebody's handwriting is only a rabbinic obligation, and so we can be lenient!</p>\n\n<p>I understand why you cannot deduce the third scenario from the first two, but it seems to me that you can deduce the first two from the third. Teach the case of the brother then - why do you need to also teach the case of one's father and one's rabbi!?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 5)\n\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yom_Tov_Asevilli\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Ritva</a> explains simply that the Mishnah is using the technique of <em>lo zu af zu</em>. That is to say that indeed the Mishnah <em>could have</em> only mentioned the case of a brother and we would know the law for a father and a teacher as well, but mishnayot sometimes list multiple cases in increasing order of novelty even when it would suffice to only list the most novel case.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>אבל אחיו דלא הא ולא הא אימא לא קמ\"ל פירוש ומתני' לא זו אף זו קתני ומסתברא דכיון דקתני אחיו דלא הא ולא הא ה\"ה לאדם רחוק דעלמא דמאי שנא ותנא דמתני' נקט הנהו דמסתמא שכיח גבייהו וידע כתבא דידהו</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>A possible answer that does not rely on mere stylistic choice is the following, loosely based on <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yaakov_Gesundheit\" rel=\"noreferrer\">R. Yaakov Gezundheit</a>'s comments in <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=8364&st=&pgnum=218\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Tiferet Yaakov C.M. 46:30</a>.</p>\n\n<p>The Talmud's conclusion — based on the fact that the Mishnah included one's brother in the list of people whose handriting he can verify — is that the reason why the person is trusted to verify the handwriting is that the verification is only a rabbinic requirement, so the Rabbis can make whatever rules they want for their own requirements. However, if the Mishnah had only mentioned that one can verify the handwriting  of his brother, we would not necessarily have known the full extent of this rule. We might have thought that the reason one can verify his brother's handwriting is that he is (somewhat) familiar with his brother, but perhaps we would not trust him to verify the handwriting of someone not related to him at all.</p>\n\n<p>This potential misunderstanding is avoided by including the father and the teacher in the list. We can no longer think that the reason why he is trusted to verify his brother's handwriting is that there is some unique familiarity with one's brother, because if that was the case then there would have been no need to list the father and teacher. By first listing the father and teacher and then listing the brother the Mishnah provides a contrast and tells us that a person is trusted to verify the handwriting of his brother even though he is less familiar with his brother. Thus, we can figure out that the reason is that the Rabbis can make up whatever rules they want for rabbinic requirements, and therefore it would turn out that he is trusted to verify <em>anyone's</em> handwriting. Note that this point itself is a dispute mentioned in Shulchan Aruch (<a href=\"http://beta.hebrewbooks.org/tursa.aspx?a=cm_x8891\" rel=\"noreferrer\">C.M. 46:17</a>).</p>\n\n<p>(Of course, this explanation doesn't address why the Mishnah didn't just say explicitly that he is trusted to verify anyone's handwriting, if that is really true, but that wasn't the question asked here.)</p>\n\n\n",

The accent should be on the first syllable of both words according to all siddurim I have seen, but the words are usually pronounced with the accent on the second syllable.</p>\n<p>I first became aware of this is when I got an aliyah in Amsterdam (Holland) and was corrected in by Rav Just זצ״ל who brought this to my attention.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>This is an excellent question. Many people, including me, don't pay much attention as to why the accent has shifted.</p>\n<p>This is a technique known as <a href=\"https://he.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D7%A0%D7%A1%D7%95%D7%92_%D7%90%D7%97%D7%95%D7%A8_(%D7%9C%D7%A9%D7%95%D7%9F)\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><em>nasog achor</em></a>. The basic idea is that two accented syllables should not appear consecutively. This technique is common in the Torah, for example, see Shemot 20:19:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>לֹא תַעֲשׂוּן, אִתִּי:  אֱ<strong>לֹ</strong>הֵי <strong>כֶ</strong>סֶף וֵאלֹ<strong>הֵי</strong> זָ<strong>הָב</strong>, לֹא תַעֲשׂוּ\nלָכֶם</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I've bolded the places that have the accented syllable. The word אלהֵי usually has it's accent on the final syllable, and this is how it is in the 2nd occurrence. In the 1st occurrence, the word כֶסֶף has its accent on the 1st syllable. Therefore, the accent on אלהֵי moves back one syllable, so as not to place two accented syllables together.</p>\n<p>Likewise, in the bracha, בנו is accented on the 1st syllable, and בחר is on the last, normally. Therefore, the accent on בחר moves backwards. Similar idea applies to לנו, which is accented on the 1st syllable. Therefore, the accent on נתן moves back one syllable.</p>\n<p>I will see if I can research why this technique developed (though, I suspect that there is nothing more to it than the exact reason that I mentioned.) It seems that this technique applies to prayer as well as Torah reading, though, the rules of mispronouncing prayer words are not as \"severe\" as mispronouncing Torah words.</p>\n<p>Keep in mind, that there are many exceptions to using this rule in Torah reading. Sometimes, a change of accent can change the meaning of the word from past to future tense, or there may be some other problem that occurs.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: -2)\n\n<p>Even though I don't really get, how are the accents are marked in your siddurim (i.e. by a meteg), but the position of the cantillation sign is a good reference for stressing the correct syllable. In the case of בחר and נתן it is on the last syllable almost exclusively (check for locations in a concordance). However, I don't know, why your acquaintances are not following this rule.</p>\n\n<p>Edit:\nPlease note that after both words come an auxiliary word - בנו, לנו - that may be connected to the previous word by a maqaf. In this case the stress can shift to the first syllable (see Bereshith 48:9, Chronicles 28:10 for reference).</p>\n\n\n",

When it follows a short vowel, it could naturally behave as a strong dagesh. However, when conjunctive dagesh follows a consonant (e.g. Josh. 5:14 according to Ben Naftali; מִשְׁכָּנֹ֥ות לֹּא־לֹֽו in Hab. 1:6 or עַל־רִ֥יב לֹּֽא־לֹֽו in Prov. 26:1; Gen. 24:36 וַיִּתֶּן־לֹּ֖ו) or a long vowel it is harder to argue that it has a geminatory ability. Based on this, he believes that the conjunctive dagesh does not close the previous syllable (Introduction to the Tiberian Masorah, pp. 295-296). </p>\n\n<p>Some texts with Babylonian vocalization write dehiq/ate merahiq as a dot between two words, and not as a regular dagesh (ג) (Kahle Masoreten des Ostens, p. 13). Moreover, the conjunctive dagesh is sometimes marked by Ben Naftali where Ben Asher marks a paseq (Yeivin p. 303). </p>\n\n<p>Still, the Karaite Arabaic transcriptions, which are known to correspond to the Tiberian pronunciation well, show a shadda (gemination marker) on some instances of dehiq/ate merahiq. Moreover, the Secunda of the Hexapla has μεββεσε for מַה־בֶּ֥צַע (Ps. 30:10). Generally, pronunciation traditions that preserve consonant gemination geminate the conjunctive dagesh.</p>\n\n\n",

Yaakov Ettlinger</a> in <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=49325&st=&pgnum=28\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Bikkurei Yaakov 639:39</a> with a bit of my own twist.)</p>\n\n<p>It seems that the question is predicated on the fact that the Mishnah in Taanit refers to the rain as a <em>siman klalah</em>. If R. Yehoshua's objection is that rain is a <em>siman  klalah</em> for the entirety of Sukkot, then indeed one can wonder why Rambam explains the parable in the Mishnah in Sukkah as only referring to the beginning of Sukkot. However, Rambam's comments may be based on a different text.</p>\n\n<p>In <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yosef_Qafih\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">R. Yosef Qafih</a>'s edition of Rambam's Commentary to the Mishnah there is an important difference in the text of the Mishnah in Taanit. Instead of ואין הגשמים אלא סימן קללה בחג it reads ואין הגשמים סימן ברכה בחג. </p>\n\n<p>In the introduction to his edition R. Qafih tells us that the text he used for the Mishnah part is taken from the manuscript in Rambam's own hand:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>את נוסח המשנה העתקתי מתוך כתב ידו של רבינו</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Additionally, we can see that the <a href=\"http://kaufmann.mtak.hu/en/ms50/ms50-077r.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Kaufmann manuscript</a> has the same alternate text:</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/aUglA.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/aUglA.jpg\" alt=\"Image of manuscript\"></a></p>\n\n<p>This being the case, we can now explain that R. Yehoshua's argument in Taanit is <em>not</em> really based on the fact that rain is like a master pouring the cup on the servant's face. Indeed, that is only true on the first day of Sukkot, as Rambam indicates in his commentary to the Mishnah in Sukkah. R. Yehoshua in Taanit is instead making a different argument. He is saying that it makes no sense to ask for rain <em>at any time</em> on Sukkot because rain will prevent us from sitting in the Sukkah. Thus, although it is not akin to the master pouring the cup in the servant's face, it is still not a good thing for it to rain on Sukkot because it prevents us from getting the mitzvah. </p>\n\n<p>R. Eliezer's response is that he's not talking about <em>asking</em> for rain; he's just talking about <em>mentioning</em> rain.</p>\n\n<p>Thus, there is no contradiction because R. Yehoshua never says that rain anytime on Sukkot is a curse. He just says that it's not a good thing. This perhaps fits especially well with Rambam's language in Taanit (in the Qafih edition) where he says basically precisely that:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>שירידת הגשמים בסוכות אינו רצוי </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The only issue is that Rambam attributes this fact to the Mishnah in Sukkah, which might seem to indicate that he's assuming that the Mishnah in Sukkah is referring to the same level of negativity as the Mishnah in Taanit. However, perhaps we could read it as simply noting that, as we find in Sukkah, rain on Sukkot is bad because it prevents us from eating in the Sukkah. It just happens to be that on the first day it is <em>especially</em> bad because the first day has a stronger requirement to eat in the Sukkah, and therefore it is likened to a master pouring the cup on the servant's face. Whereas for the rest of Sukkot it's just a regular negative thing.</p>\n\n<p>This can be further supported by the following argument: The question here assumes that R. Yehoshua's argument to R. Eliezer was that we can't ask for rain on Sukkot because that would be a <em>siman klalah</em>. But wait a minute. How would it be a <em>siman klalah</em> if we <em>asked</em> for it? That would mean that God granted our request which would be considered a <em>good</em> thing. But according to how we explained it above, this works out. It might be nice that God is answering our request, but it's still a bad idea to make the request because it will prevent us from getting a mitzvah.</p>\n\n<p>An alternative is that R. Yehoshua's argument is an \"according to your own view\" (<em>leshitatcha</em>) argument. According to R. Yehoshua himself there would be no problem with rain beyond the first day of Sukkot, because the only real obligation is to have a meal on the first night. However, R. Eliezer earlier in Chapter Two of Sukkah is of the opinion that one is obligated to have two meals <em>every day</em> of Sukkot:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>רבי אליעזר אומר ארבע עשרה סעודות חייב אדם לאכול בסוכה אחת ביום ואחת בלילה</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Thus, R. Yehoshua's argument is specifically directed against R. Eliezer in light of R. Eliezer's other view. He is saying that it is contradictory to ask for rain on any day of Sukkot if you hold that there are obligatory meals on every day of Sukkot.</p>\n\n<p>Another alternative is that Rambam's reference to \"the beginning of Sukkot\" is not meant to contrast with rain that occurs on the rest of Sukkot. Rather, it is meant to contrast with rain that already began <em>before</em> Sukkot. Such rain is not considered like a master pouring the cup on his servant's face, whereas any rain that began on Sukkot — on any day of Sukkot — is likened to a master pouring the cup on his servant's face. </p>\n\n\n",

I was told, the Zohar would explain it as follows: a) le'Avdah = all 248 positive mitzvos; b) u'LeShamrah = all 365 negative mitzvos. The Zohar would seemingly derive this meaning from the next 2 verses (2:16-17), which indeed describe commandments (\"eat\" and \"do not eat\"). But still, it seems odd.

'To work it': with positive mitsvot, 'and to guard it': with negative mitsvot.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Perhaps the Tikkunei Zohar was indeed motivated by the interpretation of גן as masculine, and therefore seeks out a different object for 'guard' and 'serve' (perhaps in the Tikkunei Zohar's interpretation it refers to Torah).</p>\n\n<p>However, importantly, the verse is understandable without resorting to <em>derush</em>. For example, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abraham_ibn_Ezra\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Ibn Ezra</a> (Ecclesiastes 2:5) writes that the word גן ('gan'; garden) can be either masculine (as in Song of Songs 4:12), or <strong>feminine as in Genesis 2:15</strong>. Similarly, <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Isaiah.1.29?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Isaiah (1:29)</a> refers to גנות, although as Ibn Ezra points out, the word also appears as גנים (e.g. <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Song_of_Songs.4.15?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Song of Songs 4:15</a>).</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isaac_Abarbanel\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">R.

Accordingly he suggests that 'to work it' refers to the ground (אדמה which is feminine) from which the garden grows.</p>\n\n<p>Alternatively, like Ibn Ezra, Radak proposes that גן in our verse is feminine, noting that the word also appears with the feminine ה at the end, as גנה.</p>\n\n<p>Ramban (Genesis 2:8) (perhaps basing himself on Radak) writes the same two explanations.</p>\n\n<p>Ramban claims that Hazal noted this grammatical issue. Specifically, for example, Genesis Rabba (16:5) says that the verse is a reference to sacrifices (קרבנות).</p>\n\n<p>For more interpretations of 'to work it and to serve it', see <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/a/53872/8775\">here</a>. Perhaps some of these explanations (such as the Sifrei there) were similarly intended to address this grammatical point.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: -1)\n\n<p>It is also possible to understand the expression “בגן-עדן” to mean “as a guardian of time or pleasure”. גן is the root for הגנה which means to protect (in a positive sense) or to defend (in a negative sense). The pleasure is that associated with his wife which was mentioned in the previous chapter (Bereshit 1:27). So the feminine connotation is referring back to his wife.</p>\n\n\n",

He brings down the Shu\"t Binyan Shlomo who says that we say Shir Shel Yom as a praise to the day (basing it off of Sanhedrin 101 - \"reading a verse at its correct time brings good to the world\"), but the Leviyim singing Shir Shel Yom was meant to be a \"Nachas Ruach\" along with the Korbanos of the day.  Since we are not doing it for that reason, once a day is enough.  He also uses this to explain why the Gra says that we should not say multiple Shirim on one day. </p>\n\n<p>(Perhaps another proof to this is that the Gra has no Shir Shel Yom for Tisha Beav, whereas in Maseches Sofrim there are multiple ones listed.  Perhaps another one is that the Shir in the Beis Hamikdash was only for Leviyim, and if so, why should we say it. Perhaps another one is where we say it during Davening, separate from Korban Hatamid.)</p>\n\n<p>In a nutshell, we don't say the Shir Shel Yom nowadays to remember the old Shir Shel Yom that they used to sing with the Korban Hatamid, but rather as reciting verses appropriate to the day itself.</p>\n\n<p>This would explain why in some cases the Shir Shel Yom that the Leviyim used to sing with the Korbanos does not correspond to those which the Gra chose, as we can suggest that he felt that some of these selections were meant to go together with Korbanos of the day, but when we have no Korbanos, the focus should be changed to those that go together with <strong>our</strong> Davening, and would be more appropriate.  </p>\n\n<p>As an example, we relate to Shavuos as the day of the giving of the Torah, and the Gra presumably felt that Psalm 19 fits that mindset better for us than Psalm 29, which was meant as a praise to accompany Korbanos on that day.  Also, any days which had no Shir Shel Yom in the Beis Hamikdash (or simply weren't listed anywhere) should not stop us from saying Shir Shel Yom of our own, which would explain Yom Kippur.  </p>\n\n<p>All in all, essentially my answer is that the Gra needed no source, as Shir Shel Yom is just about bringing out something that is meaningful for that day.  He also does not contradict Maseches Sofrim, because Maseches Sofrim is talking about what WAS in the Beis Hamikdash, whereas we do not say Shir Shel Yom as related to that.</p>\n\n\n",

To buy something on credit is equivalent to a loan (5:2); to buy something overpriced or underpriced significantly falls under the laws of ona’ah, for which if all parties are aware of the fact that one is getting cheated and they proceed with the sale anyway, the sale is binding (BM 4:3-6). </p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p><strong>Situation a: Investor purchases an entity that makes him money plus interest.</strong> He is making a purchase of stock that will ultimately make him much more than what he paid.

Does it make a difference if Yom Tov itself goes directly into Shabbos (“three day Yom Tov”)?</p>\n\n<p>On the one hand: The Mechaber says explicitly (OC 531) that except in certain extreme circumstances, one may not shave on Chol HaMoed. This is even if he shaved on Erev Yom Tov.</p>\n\n<p>On the other hand: Mishnah Berurah (531:3) writes that the reason for this is because if they allowed shaving on Chol HaMoed, one might go into Yom Tov without shaving, relying on the fact that he can shave during Chol HaMoed. This would seem to indicate that since the entire reason one isn’t allowed to shave on Chol HaMoed is to honor Yom Tov, when one is shaving in order to honor Yom Tov it should be permissible. </p>\n\n<p>Furthermore, the Mishnah Berurah earlier (530:1) set forth five general categories of Melacha permitted on Yom Tov, the first of which is something which will be lost if done later. Shaving for the sake of Yom Tov would seem to fall into that category. He further writes there that for a melacha related to Chol HaMoed that doesn’t have to do with eating, any non-specialized task is permissible. Nowadays, shaving would seem to fall into this category. He later specifies that this holds even if its for an individual’s needs and not for the public. </p>\n\n<p>And yet, in spite of these logics, the Shulchan Aruch still writes that only in certain cases may one shave on Chol HaMoed.</p>\n\n<p>Which way do we hold?

Perhaps according to these latter two opinions, by scattering them and changing their languages, like in the former opinion, they would be incapable of influencing each other in their wicked ways. </p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>Rav Hirsch stated that the more the community pressured everyone to think alike, the more the people resisted and tried to follow their own way of thinking. Hashem made the miracle of forcing the actual change in language to follow these ways of thought in order to have it happen so rapidly. Rav Hirsch does not deal with archeology or anything else other than the meaning in his commentary.</p>\n\n<p>When they were one community, then trying to make a <em>name</em> for themselves was an attempt to rebel against Hashem and replace Him with the head of the government. Once they were dispersed and speaking other languages, then even if each one individually, <strong>tried</strong> to <em>make a name for itself</em>, it would not be an attempt to defeat the purpose of filling up the world, but would instead actually cause a further dispersal into multiple civilizations.</p>\n\n<p>Note that I.L. means that the translator (the grandson of Rav Hirsch, Rabbi Isaac Levi) added an explanation to the translation of Rav Hirsch's commentary.</p>\n\n<p>Rav Hirsch says that the pasuk means</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>\"Safa Achas\" means the phonetic sameness of speech (the sound of the\n  language I.L) which is fundamentally based on organic causes. \"Devarim\n  Achadim\" is the sameness of the formation of words and sentences which\n  is brought about by spiritual mental agreement in the way that things\n  and their relations are looked at.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Rav Hirsch points out in Noach 2:7, that the words used for matters like \"justice\", \"virtue\", or \"charity\" in different languages can have completely different connotations. It would appear that even though everyone thought that they were speaking the original language (from the time of Adam), Hashem changed what they were saying to have the connotation that they really wanted and made them into the differing languages.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>For example, think for a minute that the word to \"have\" was missing\n  from our vocabulary. In Hebrew it does not exist. \"To have\" has the\n  conception of corporal holding fast, \"habere\", \"avere\" to desire\n  something, and when one has seized it, then one \"has it\". Let us\n  imagine that this conception was not there, a man could only consider\n  that to be his which really appertains to him, like לו in Hebrew. ...\n  Then the first person who introduced the idea of \"have\" (I have it,\n  whether or not it pertains to me or not I.L.) would indeed have\n  brought about the greatest revolution; he would have changed the idea\n  of right to the idea of \"grab\".</p>\n  \n  <p>...</p>\n  \n  <p>The attempt by the community by this building to do away with the\n  individuality of the individual was broken by the awakening\n  consciousness of the independent value of the individual, apart from\n  his value as a unit of the community.</p>\n  \n  <p>So that the disunion did not arise out of a number of languages but the\n  other way round. It was the discord which first begot the\n  disruption of the language, so that at the beginning, the Safa Achas\n  could still have remained ... without the climatic change, even before\n  the scattering which ensued in the safa achas there was no longer\n  devarim achadim. This variance in opinions drove people completely\n  away from one another, where then the climactic differences of the\n  regions had the influence of making them and their languages\n  completely and organically different.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Rav Hirsch points out that normally these developments would take place over a long period of time. However, Hashem caused them to occur almost instantaneously so that the entire development of the \"Migdal Bavel\" would collapse and cause the immediate dispersion of the various peoples.</p>\n\n\n",

Is this the answer, and what are the sources which support it?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/1594241/jewish/Did-the-Jews-Disregard-Ezekiels-Prophecy-of-the-Temple.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">R Yehuda Shurpin at chabad.org</a> writes, in a nutshell, that Ezekiel's vision applied to a Temple built after full repentance and for an everlasting redemption. However, since the Jews repentance was only partial, the redemption was only partial and the Temple wasn't built to be everlasting, e.g., it lacked critical components such as the Holy Ark.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>In commanding Ezekiel to describe the dimensions of the Temple to the\n  Jewish people, G‑d <a href=\"http://www.chabad.org/library/bible_cdo/aid/16141#v=10\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">says</a>:</p>\n  \n  <p>You, son of man, describe the House to the House of Israel, that they\n  may be ashamed of their iniquities; let them measure its plan. And if\n  they are ashamed of all that they have done, let them know the form of\n  the House and its scheme, its exits and its entrances, and all its\n  forms, and all its laws and all its teachings, and write it down in\n  their sight so that they keep the whole form thereof and the laws\n  thereof, and do them.</p>\n  \n  <p>The Sages in the Midrash explain that when Ezekiel heard this, he\n  turned to G‑d and asked,</p>\n  \n  <p>What is the point of saying this to the Jewish people if they are in\n  exile and will not build this Temple now? Let me wait until they are\n  redeemed and then I will tell them this prophecy.</p>\n  \n  <p>G‑d replied: Just because my children are in exile there should be no building of\n  My House?! [...]</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>As the Rambam already noted in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Mishneh_Torah,_The_Chosen_Temple.1.4?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Mishne Torah Bet Habechira 1:4</a></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The building which Solomon built has already been described in I\n  Kings. Similarly, the Temple which will be built in the future which\n  is mentioned in Ezekiel, is not described clearly or completely.

This is because, we consider the galus bavel as being the primary determinant of various halachos regarding chutz la'aretz. Thus, even though every location could theoretically have its own time (and a reversal in the Southern hemisphere), we (that is everyone in <em>chutz la'aretz</em>) follow the zmanim for the <em>primary galus</em>, which is Bavel.</p>\n\n<p>Many communities objected, but the Babylonian rabbinate insisted on a uniform date so as to prevent <em>multiple torahs</em> from arising. Bavel was then the primary <em>galus community</em>. Even though this is no longer the case, we maintain the same <em>minhag avoseinu beyadeinu</em>. Note that if we switched to a different community (or everyone for the local time) we could be praying for rain at the time when it is not permitted because of <em>Eretz Yisrael</em>.</p>\n\n<p>Additionally, the extra delay is because we need to wait longer for people to reach the galus after <em>aliyas laregel</em>.

This is also the reason we (Ashkenazim) do not say <em>mizmor letodah</em> on any of these days.</p>\n<p>My question is about <em>erev yom kippur</em>. I understand that we don't say <em>mizmor letodah</em>, or the <em>yehi ratzon</em> for the <em>todah</em>, because the <em>todah</em> could not be brought on <em>erev yom kippur</em>, when the start of the fast in the evening would limit the time for eating the <em>korban</em> (which could normally be eaten during the night following the day on which it was brought).</p>\n<p>But why does Artscroll imply that one does say the <em>yehi ratzon</em> for the <em>chatat</em>, <em>asham</em> and <em>shelamim</em>? None of these could be brought on <em>erev yom kippur</em> either.

However, see in Yabia Omer (9:1) who writes at length on this subject and concludes that nowadays it is indeed an obligation to walk around with a proper head covering. In any case, being that it is not an absolute obligation, it does not warrant a separate berachah.</p>\n\n<p>The Shulchan Aruch (46:1) actually states that there is a berachah which is recited for wearing a Kippah, or wrapping our head, and it is the berachah of “Oter Yisrael b’tifarah.” The Bet Yosef explains that even though this berachah was originally meant for people who used to wear a turban or proper head covering, it is customary to nevertheless recite this berachah even for those who only wear a small head covering.

Psalm 91 has only 112 words, so at the beginning we add the last verse of Psalm 90 that has 12 words, and we repeat the last verse of Psalm 91 that has 5 words. We count 1 for the whole psalm.

I told myself that I would learn these halachot before next Sukkot בלי נדר but I was unsure where to learn. My first thought was Shulchan 'Aruch. Although I would love to learn the halachot with more attention to detail, I thought realistically to myself that a pamphlet/small book would likely be better to study for this.</p>\n\n<p>With that in mind, I was wondering if there is a sefer which is effectively a קצור הלחות ד׳ מינים, either in Hebrew or Hebrew and English translations.(The only thing I saw which fit the קצור qualification was an English-only Eider pamphlet. This was exactly what I was looking for, except for the fact that I want to learn the halachot in Hebrew). Ideally, it should have illustrations, considering that the form of the species relates to its kashrut.

An example being how one tells another of the importance of not drinking and driving. In many instances (especially in PSAs) we see deceased individuals held up as examples of these sorts of mistakes. </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>\"Patrick drank and drove, now he's dead and so are the two innocent people he killed through his actions.

This is like Hashem promising not to wipe out all of Bnai Yisrael, because no matter how bad things get, the bechirah chofshis means that there will always be some people worthy of being saved.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>וַיָּ֣רַח יְהֹוָה֘ אֶת־רֵ֣יחַ הַנִּיחֹ֒חַ֒ וַיֹּ֨אמֶר יְהֹוָ֜ה\n  אֶ <code>expression of compliance</code>.ל־לִבּ֗וֹ לֹ֣א אֹ֠סִ֠ף לְקַלֵּ֨ל ע֤וֹד אֶת־הָֽאֲדָמָה֙ בַּֽעֲב֣וּר\n  הָֽאָדָ֔ם כִּ֠י יֵ֣צֶר לֵ֧ב הָֽאָדָ֛ם רַ֖ע מִנְּעֻרָ֑יו וְלֹֽא־אֹסִ֥ף\n  ע֛וֹד לְהַכּ֥וֹת אֶת־כָּל־חַ֖י כַּֽאֲשֶׁ֥ר עָשִֽׂיתִי:</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Rav Hirsch translates אֶת־רֵ֣יחַ הַנִּיחֹ֒חַ֒ as <code>expression of compliance</code></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>But Noach had the whole of future mankind before him, his offering\n  referred to all that which, in the course of time, was to be\n  accomplished by the <strong>whole</strong> of mankind to the final complete\n  satisfaction of hashem with Man, hence his offering was ריח הניחוח, an\n  indication of the complete compliance with Hashem's Will to which the\n  whole of Mankind is to mature on the freshly regained Earth, now\n  dedicated to be an altar of Hashem.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Rav Hirsch also addresses <code>כִּ֠י יֵ֣צֶר לֵ֧ב הָֽאָדָ֛ם רַ֖ע מִנְּעֻרָ֑יו</code> and translates it not as <code>because</code> but as <code>even if</code>.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>when the images formed by the heart of Man from his youth, neither\n  will I again smite any more every living thing</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>That is, even if the youth are dedicated to evil (so that there may be a reason to do this again), Hashem will not destroy the world again as the next generation in its rebellion against their fathers will go against the evil (as the time for each generation had decreased) because the world can be redeemed and would continue in the normal course of its cycles.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>But as long as the bad ones reached their seven to eight hundred\n  years, a better youth did not get a chance. In this new shortness of\n  life, Hashem can make a generation die out quickly and a better one\n  grow up in its place. Since then, mankind can ever look forward, and\n  hope, and the future belong to youth. </p>\n  \n  <p>...</p>\n  \n  <p>If we add to this diversity of individuals, the still greater\n  diversity of nations, which the new arrangements for the earth\n  effected, and also the natural hindrance to communication brought\n  about by the division of the earth into continents and countries which\n  will only be <em>(is being, I.L.)</em> slowly overcome after thousands of\n  years; if we think how, thereby, for thousands of years no\n  degeneration spread universally over the world, and how, just as in\n  the quicker change of the generations in the individuals, so thereby\n  the wider development of the history of nations was started in which\n  nenations with fresh unvitiated powers always take theplace of\n  degenerated enervated ones: then, with this verse, everything is said\n  by which Hashem started a completely new phase in the development and\n  education of mankind. \"<em>If</em>\", says Hashem, \"<em>the endeavors of mankind\n  are bad, and even from youth are devoted to evil, I will not, -- as I\n  have done before -- for Man's own sake disturb the earth, and bring\n  about universal destruction, but will rather arrange that all the\n  contrasts of the times of days and years henceforth shall be present\n  and working simultaneously on the earth</em>\".</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>The <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isaac_ben_Moses_Arama\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Akedat Yitshak</a> (<a href=\"http://beta.hebrewbooks.org/reader/reader.aspx?sfid=49507#p=73&fitMode=fitwidth&hlts=&ocr=%25u05D2%25u05DC%25u05D5%25u05D9%20%25u05D5%25u05D9%25u05D3%25u05D5%25u05E2\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">B'reshit Sha'ar 14</a>) explains that the sacrifice that Noah offered was not the direct reason for God to promise not to destroy Man. Rather, it was indicative of a permanent change in the nature of mankind, such that God knew (not decided) that he would not destroy them:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>אמר אל לבו לא אוסיף לקללם כי גלוי וידוע לפניו טבע תכונות האדם ומה שקבלו בזה מההכנעה וההרתעה הטבעית והמוסר המוטבע ביצירתם עד שיספיק זה לשלא יבאו עוד להפסד כולל כמו הראשונים אשר אחזו מעשי אבותיהם בידיהם ונמחו מעל פני האדמה. ולזה ידע כי לא יקלל עוד את האדמה בכלל בעבור האדם </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>See further there how he explains the seeming conflicting reason given; that Man's inclination is evil from his youth.</p>\n\n<p>This is similarly the implication of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Kimhi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Radak</a> who writes (Genesis 8:21)</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>...כי ידע כי לא יהיה בעולם עוד כמו אותו הדור\n  ויאמר ה' אל לבו - ראה בשכלו שלא ישחית עוד את האדמה כי לא יהיה עוד רעים רבים, ויוסרו מדור המבול שיהיה קבלה בידם דור אחר דור </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>God knew that mankind would never return to its antediluvian state, and that there would be a tradition of the flood that would be transmitted to future generations to keep them in check. That is, God did not change his mind or decide (in the classical sense) not to destroy Man. Rather, circumstances changed, and given the circumstances, God <em>knew</em> that he would no longer need to destroy man.</p>\n\n<p>Tangentially, regarding the seeming contradiction in reasons to not destroy Man, with verse 21 indicating a different reason; Man's bad nature, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saadia_Gaon\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rav Saadya Gaon</a> (there) understands the verse differently.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>לֹֽא־אֹ֠סִף לְקַלֵּ֨ל ע֤וֹד אֶת־הָֽאֲדָמָה֙ בַּעֲב֣וּר הָֽאָדָ֔ם כִּ֠י יֵ֣צֶר לֵ֧ב הָאָדָ֛ם רַ֖ע מִנְּעֻרָ֑יו</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>It doesn't mean that the reason that God would not destroy man is that he is bad natured, rather it means that God would not destroy Man <em>over</em> his bad nature. That is, it is saying that <em>in spite</em> of Man's nature, God would not destroy him.</p>\n\n\n",

And when the\n  unqualified term פִּדְיוֹן, “redemption” is employed, it means\n  [redeeming with money. — [Torath Kohanim 19:53]</p>\n  \n  <p><strong>nor had her document of emancipation been granted her</strong>:\n  [the unqualified term חוֹפשׁ, “freeing,” refers to doing so] with a\n  document [of release]. — [Torath Kohanim 19:53]</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Since she is <em>half a Jew</em>, she is forbidden to a slave, just as any other Jewish woman. Since she is <em>half a slave</em> she is forbidden to a Jewish man.</p>\n\n<p>However, she is not subject to the punishment for adultery either, as that only applies to a legitimately married woman (who is fully Jewish). If a Jew has relations with her, and they are both aware of the sin, then she gets lashes and he is required to bring a sin offering.</p>\n\n\n",

Where should he go? Assume that one of these 2 places count on him to form the minyan. Without him, they won't get anyone else.</p>\n\n<p>2 - A mourner cannot get a minyan at his home unless the minyan (consisting of exactly 10 people) from shul would all come to his home. Should these 10 people daven in the shul, or should they all form a minyan in the mourner's home?</p>\n\n<p>These people cannot daven at both places because, I believe, there is a rule that at least 6 people should not have previously davened in order to be able to repeat the Amidah. <br/><sup>(Source: Kitzur S.A.  <a href=\"http://www.toratemetfreeware.com/online/f_00561.html#HtmpReportNum0019_L2\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">סימן כ - דין חזרת תפלת השליח צבור</a>) <br/> אֵין אוֹמְרִים תְּפִלַּת שְׁמֹנֶה עֶשְׂרֵה בְּקוֹל, אֶלָּא אִם כֵּן יֵשׁ לְכָל הַפָּחוֹת שִׁשָּׁה אֲנָשִׁים, שֶׁהֵם רֹב מִנְיָן שֶׁהִתְפַּלְּלוּ עַתָּה.‏</sup></p>\n\n<p>The main concern - Does davening in a shul have the highest priority?

The Mishneh Berurah (55/73) writes about people interrupting learning in order to keep the minyan in shul on a steady basis. It would seem that based on the above, the minyan in shul should be the one to go to.

Chazal knew that this was their opinion, therefore they introduced it as a <em>hava aminah</em> and refute it with a drasha on the verse.

The context is the Talmud proposing multiple suggestions and rejecting them for the same reason. Once it knows the reason it known that the proposals cannot actually be true. Rather the purpose is pedagogical; using the process of elimination to show that no other solution could be correct [i]:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>מהוה הוו כו' - ואורחא דסוגיא דגמרא (להקשות) +מסורת הש\"ס: [לתרץ]+ דבר שאינו, עד דטרח ומעמידה על בורייה, מפי רבי עד כאן </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>This is not exactly the same as the examples in the question, but it is very similar.</p>\n\n<p>Similarly, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isaiah_di_Trani\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">R. Yeshaya di Trani</a> writes (Tosafot Rid Pesahim 77b) that the Talmud suggests weaker answers first that it knows are untennable in order to then propose the actual solution in order to show via the process of elimination, that it is the only viable solution:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>וכן דרך התלמוד תחלה מתרץ תירוצים קלים שאין עומדין ואח\"כ מתרץ העיקר כדי להרחיב הסברא ולהראות שאין לתרץ אלא בענין זה</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Similarly, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shlomo_ibn_Aderet\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rashba</a> (Megilla 2a) suggests that a question and answer in the Talmud are rhetorical, and he writes that this is common in the Talmud:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>ולי נראה דמי שאמר כדבעינן למימר קמן הוא ששאל תחלה מנא לן <strong>ולפרושה למתני' בדרך קושיא ותירוץ הוא</strong>, ודכותה איכא טובא בגמ'</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Similarly, his student <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yom_Tov_Asevilli\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Ritva</a> writes (Megillah 2b) that some of the Talmud's proposals are rhetorical:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><strong>ודאי כל הני ואימא ואימא דאמרינן בסוגיא לא פירכי ממש נינהו אלא לברורי דרך קושיא ותירוץ</strong>, והיינו דאמרינן ואימא י\"ג, שיקראו עיירות בי\"ד או בט\"ו דבתרוייהו ליכא למימר כדלעיל וכרכים בי\"ג, ואף על גב דיהבי חשיבותא לעיירות טפי להקדים כרכים לעיירות ולקבוע להם ימים שלא היו למנוחה, דילמא אה\"נ, והא ודאי לאו פירכא היא דליכא למפרך כי הא, אלא ברור הוא כדאמרינן כנ\"ל.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>An idea somewhat similar to R. Kasher's (though not as comprehensive) is stated by the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samson_of_Chinon\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Sefer HaKritut</a> (L'shon Limmudim Shaar 2:54):</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>מצינו ששונה במשנה דבר שאינו צריך רק להוציא מלב השוטים כי הא דשילהי החולץ (דף נ') אשתו שמתה מותר באחותה אמר רב יוסף כאן שנה רבי משנה שאינה צריכה</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>More directly, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Weiss_Halivni\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Prof. David Weiss HaLivni</a> writes [ii] that early Midrashim may have indeed posed suggestions specifically as part of polemics against those who espoused them, but in later Midrashim it is merely a rhetorical device. Among the Ammoraim, this form is rare, but among anonymous passages in the Talmud, which he identifies as a later stratum of Stammaim, this is common as a rhetorical device.</p>\n\n<p>Also interesting, though less related, is <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/a/78735/8775\">R. Shaul Lieberman's position</a> that Hazal said that it is a mitsvah to marry one's niece, specifically to oppose the sectarians who claimed it was forbidden.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>[i] This is also clear from Rashi on a similar passage (Shabbat 104a) in which he makes clear that the Talmud designs the questions to answer them as part of dialectical technique:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>ואין זו קושיא, שכן דרך התלמוד, המקשן מהפך הסברא כאן כדי שיקשה, ובמקום אחר מהפכו לפי הקושיא </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Note also Rashi Yoma (13a) s.v.

So Noach only fulfilled the idea of coming to the ark, but not entering inside, in order to demonstrate that he believed the decree would be averted.</p>\n\n<p>When G-d started the rains to fall, Noach knew that the decree would be fulfilled and was forced inside.</p>\n\n\n",

Therefore, Rabbenu Tam concludes that the statue must not have been an actual idol, but was rather just meant to honour the king.</p>\n\n<p>Thus, it is clear that according to <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rabbeinu_Tam\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Rabbenu Tam</a>, even in the case of torture the obligation exists as with a case of death.</p>\n\n<p>This is seconded by <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yom_Tov_Asevilli\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Ritva</a> who writes (there):</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>עיקר הפירוש כדפירש ר\"ת ז\"ל דטעמא משום דצלמא דנבוכדנצר לאו ע\"ז הוה דאם כן דכו\"ע כשם שיהרג ואל יעבור כך ילקה כל יסורים שבעולם ולא יעבור </p>\n  \n  <p>The primary explanation is that of Rabbenu Tam OBM that the reason [they would have worshiped] was that the statue of Nebuchadnezzar was not idolatrous, for if it were, according to all just as one must be killed and not transgress, so must one be undergo all the suffering in the world, and not transgress.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>This is also assumed by <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moshe_Feinstein\" rel=\"noreferrer\">R. Moshe Feinstein</a> in Igrot Moshe (OH Vol. V:13).</p>\n\n<p>However, there is a dissenting view cited in the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bezalel_Ashkenazi\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Shitta Mekubetset</a> there who opines that one is not obligated to undergo torture:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>ובקונטריסין כתוב וז\"ל אלמלא נגדוהו פי' ה\"ר אליעזר דלא חייבה תורה אלא למסור עצמן למיתה כדכתיב בכל נפשך אפילו הוא נוטל את נפשך אבל להחמיר עליהם יותר ממיתה לא היו חייבים ויפה פי' ומה שהקשה עליו ר\"ת ז\"ל מר' עקיבא וחבריו שסרקו את בשרו במסרקות של ברזל ולא פלח. נ\"ל דלא קשה מידי דהתם הכאה שיש בה קצבה הויא דכיון שסרקו את בשרו ברור הוא שימות במיתה גמורה במהרה וההיא הויא כמו נוטל את נפשך. אבל הא דאמר רב אלמלי נגדוהו כו' פירושו הכאה בלא מיתה קאמר כגון שהניחום שנה או שנתים ויכו אותם בכל יום והויא הכאה שאין לה קצבה שהיא חמירא יותר ממלקות ומיתה ובהא לא חייבתו תורה דלאו נוטל את נפשך הוא ע\"כ </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>He adds that the case of R. Akiva was in actuality not included in this since his death was imminent, and he would not need to undergo protracted torture.</p>\n\n<p>For what its worth, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._David_Bleich\" rel=\"noreferrer\">R. J. David Bleich</a> claims in <a href=\"http://traditionarchive.org/news/_pdfs/89-121%20Bleich.pdf\" rel=\"noreferrer\">this article</a> that:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>It is thus clear that the consensus of halakhic opinion is that, when martyrdom is required, acceptance of torture is required as well.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>He bases this on the assertion regarding the view cited in the Shitta Mekubetzet:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>that view is an individual opinion and is implicitly rejected by a host of other authorities who address the problem and propose entirely different solutions.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>However, his only cited source is Tosafot. In my opinion, this is too small a sample size to determine that the view in the ShM is rejected. More significant, in my opinion, is the absence of discussion of cases of torture being an exception to the normal inviolability of cardinal sins, in classical literature disussing martyrdom.</p>\n\n\n",

The new full Torah has a higher level of sanctity than just a Chumash. </p>\n\n<p>However if a woman does the same thing, the new object does not have the higher holiness of a Sefer Torah but is just a Chumash that happens to have all 5 books in it. (The Drisha (YD 281) argued on this, but the Shulchan Arukh (ibid. :3) and most later authorities reject him.) What she did is <em>completely permitted</em>, but it's not effective in the way she may have intended. This scroll wouldn't fulfill the biblical commandments of writing a Torah scroll (Chinukh #613), reading from a Torah scroll on Sukkot following Shemitta (#612), or a king writing a Torah scroll (#503), nor would it get the same level of respect (#257) as a kosher Torah scroll such as when stacking scrolls (YD 282:19) or according to some standing when it is in movement (ibid. :2).</p>\n\n<p>Regarding using it for the rabbinic enactment of regular public reading, there is extensive Halakhic literature in the Beit Yosef OC 143 and YD 279 (in the context of mistakes found during Torah reading) about using a Chumash scroll for Torah reading and more generally using Torah scrolls with non-apparent problems, and, as any synagogue rabbi will tell you, the range of positions is vast. Generally speaking, there might be some room for leniency, particularly for Ashkenazim, if this were the only scroll available (per the end of the Rama OC 134:4 quoting the Ran), and very likely the reading wouldn't need to be repeated if it had already been accidentally read from (per the custom in the Rambam's famous responsum, accepted after the fact by the Shulchan Arukh OC 134:4). But there's essentially no room to allow using such a scroll in a Lekhatchila situation. We're talking highly controversial minority opinions here for very Bedieved situations only.</p>\n\n<p>In the end of the day, while such a scroll could certainly be used regularly for personal study, with the ubiquity of printed works it really just seems like a big waste of time. Plus you'd have to be very careful (cf. YD 281:1 with Taz, etc.) to ensure it doesn't get mixed up with identical looking Sifrei Torah written by men. If a woman wants to write STaM, she'd be much better off spending her time writing Nevi'im or the like for actual regular use in synagogues.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>I found <a href=\"https://library.yctorah.org/files/2016/07/Linzer-Sefer-torah-response-FINAL.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">this useful article</a> that has a pretty comprehensive analysis on the issue. I will edit in some additional info, IY\"H, when I have more time. For now, I am citing part of the conclusion / summary from the article.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>In summation, there is certainly no basis to allow a sefer Torah\n  written by a woman as valid either le-khathilah, or, in reliance on\n  Rambam, bi-she'at ha-dehaq. The most that can be said is that if one\n  does read from such a Torah, it is no worse than reading from sifrei\n  Torah with other disqualifying flaws, and such a person fulfills his\n  obligation be-di-'avad.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>To understand the context of the above citation, much of the rest of the article focuses on distinguishing between a woman writing a Torah for the purpose of writing a Torah (one mitzvah in itself), which would be permitted (according to most opinions) vs. her writing one for the purpose of congregational reading (most opinions object to this.) The reason for the objection, here, is based on whether women have an obligation to hear congregational Torah reading. Add to that a general rule that someone who cannot fulfill others in the mitzvah cannot be involved in the mitzvah. Based on combining these 2 ideas, many claim that a woman cannot write a Torah for congregational reading.</p>\n\n<p>However, even that opinion is somewhat ambiguous, and it's discussed more in the article. As stated, I'll try to edit in some relevant parts, later.</p>\n\n\n",

The owner must reimburse the purchaser for the money that he paid the thief. This measure was ordained to enable uninhibited trade in the marketplace. The owner then sues the thief for the money he paid.</p>\n<p>If the thief's reputation was known, our Sages did not ordain any leniency. The owner is not required to pay the purchaser anything, and instead, the purchaser must sue the thief and collect the money he paid from him.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This is also confirmed by <a href=\"https://he.wikisource.org/wiki/%D7%A9%D7%95%D7%9C%D7%97%D7%9F_%D7%A2%D7%A8%D7%95%D7%9A_%D7%97%D7%95%D7%A9%D7%9F_%D7%9E%D7%A9%D7%A4%D7%98_%D7%A9%D7%A0%D7%95_%D7%91\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Choshen Mishpat 356:2</a>. So if the original owner didn't give up the hope and he has witnesses that the guy, who sold you the watch, had stolen it, you have to give back the watch and you can ask the price you paid (I assume that you are not a fence for the second option). The Gemarah discusses in particular, whether it is enough to claim that the item was stolen, and concludes that one may simply spread a word of theft to get back items that were actually sold. This means that the owner has to bring a proof of theft.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Priestly blessing for a different minyan - any need for kohen to participate?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>In Israel in as shul that has two shacharis minyanim one after the other, a kohen comes in for the second minyan just as the first minyan is coming to the priestly blessing. Should this kohen perform the priestly blessing for the first minyan?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>It's strongly implied (S\"A O\"C 128:2) that if a Kohen is in the room when the Chazzan calls \"Kohanim\" (or some other form of the Kohen being called up to give the blessing), he has an obligation to say the blessing and violates a Mitzvah if he does not.</p>\n\n<p>The Chayei Adam writes (32:28) that a Kohen who hasn't prayed yet and is by a Minyan that is up to Birkas Kohanim should do the blessing then and pray afterwards. While it doesn't explicitly describe what the law would be if the Kohen plans on being at a later Minyan, taking these two sources together, I would suggest that if a Kohen is at an earlier Minyan and is in a scenario where he gets 'called up' to do Birkas Kohanim, he would have an obligation to do so.</p>\n\n<p>There is also a Beiur Halacha on S\"A O\"C 128:4 that implies that one should not put himself in a scenario where he is exempting himself from doing the Mitzvah of Birkas Kohanim, although admittedly that might not apply in this scenario where the Kohen is intending to do the Mitzvah later.</p>\n\n<p>It would seem based on this that the ideal situation would be for a Kohen to not put himself in a situation where he gets an obligation to say Birkas Kohanim. There are a handful of scenarios that obligates a Kohen to do Birkas Kohanim, recounted at the end of O\"C 128:4. Therefore it would seem that perhaps waiting outside the sanctuary or in a side room until after Chazaras Hashatz would be preferred.</p>\n\n<p>Note that the other way around (where the Kohen has already done Birkas Kohanim and happens to be in another Minyan later), the Kohen does not have to do Birkas Kohanim again (S\"A O\"C 128:3).</p>\n\n\n",

This rule is also applicable for any governing position, and includes a commander in the Army and any officer in the Army, or even the one who is merely responsible for the reservoir which irrigates the fields. It goes without saying that a convert cannot be appointed Judge or President.

Rabbi Henkin argues that there are three possible circumstances for one to use the name of a deity: 1) one uses it as a landmark (e.g. meet me near this avodah zarah), which shows honor to the deity because one could have easily chosen a different landmark; 2) one who says the name for no reason whatsoever, which would be prohibited because it is totally unnecessary; and 3) one who refers to the name of a deity for identification purposes in the course of normal conversation simply because there is no other way to refer to the city or place in question than by mentioning its name. Rabbi Henkin argues that the Shulchan Aruch only intended to prohibit the first and second types of mention, but not the third. After all, he argues, what is one who wants to relate an experience that took place in such a city supposed to do? The only way to express himself is by using the name of the city. This is different than using the avodah zarah as a landmark because one could have just as easily used a different landmark for the meeting place.</p>\n  \n  <p>Considering the absence of this leniency from all of the classical\n  poskim, it is very difficult to rely on. Indeed, Rabbi Henkin himself\n  seems unwilling to rely on this leniency for a deity that is still in\n  existence and worshipped. Furthermore, the Gemara asks how it was\n  permissible to identify the city in which Ulla slept by its, name\n  which is after an avodah zarah. The Gemara answers that the avodah\n  zarah the particular city was named for is already mentioned in the\n  Torah. The Gemara noticeable does NOT answer that since there is no\n  other way to identify the city, it is permissible.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Contextually, that the name of the city is an honorific, would seem to be even more of a problem than had it been the idol's actual given name. (This would seem to be the case as well with the many cities/states the world over named after saints.)</p>\n\n\n",

I know there are rulings that don't make this distinction.) before he would be required to wash and say \"hamotzi\" that addresses the various pizza styles?

A person may understand if they ever went to big mixed gender parties or studied in mixed gender schools. Men and women tend to think <a href=\"https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/explorations-of-the-mind/202401/a-short-journey-into-male-and-female-brains\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">differently</a>: men think sequentially while women think in parallel with many thoughts at the same time. Men easier pick the main idea, women pay attention to details. When many men get together they keep independence, and their plurality/group with multiple parallel thoughts thinks as a <em>female</em>! When many women get together, the opposite occurs. They all act the same. For example, when a guy approaches a girl from a group and gets rejected, all girls in her group start rejecting him. Thus, a group of women thinks like a <em>male</em>!</p>\n<p>The book Joshua Blau \"<a href=\"https://www.eisenbrauns.org/books/titles/978-1-57506-129-0.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Phonology and Morphology of Biblical Hebrew</a>\" on pp. 279 - 280 discusses four different hypotheses as a possible answer to the question. The book notes that this is a stark contradistinction to other parts of speech, which characterizes Semitic languages in general (except where later development has blured it), which has not yet been explained adequately. The four suggested answers adduce to three theories not because they are substantiated, but because they attest to <em>one of the fundamental weaknesses inherent of historical linguistics: logically built theories, ingeniously conjectured and reflecting profound knowledge of the subject, very often remain beautifu hypotheses, without possibility of verification</em>.</p>\n<p>For pedagogical reasons I am also going to bring an oldest fifth theory from <a href=\"https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Gesenius%27_Hebrew_Grammar\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Gesenius' Hebrew Grammar</a> pp. 286-287 and start with it. The first three theories assume that numerals were nouns first and afterwards evolved into a separate part of speech.</p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Gesenius%27_Hebrew_Grammar/97._Numerals._(a)_Cardinal_Numbers\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Explanation 0</a>. Brockelmann</strong>, <em>Sem. Sprachwiss.</em> p. 116 ff; <em>Grundriss</em>, i. 484 ff.</p>\n<p>The formation of the cardinal numbers from 3 to 10 (but not 1 and 2) has the peculiarity that numerals connected with a masculine substantive take the feminine form, and those with a feminine substantive take the masculine form. The common explanation of this strange phenomenon used to be that the primary form of the numeral was an abstract noun in the <em>feminine</em>, i.e. ending with Heh (ה) or Tav (ת). This was originally attached in the <em>construct state</em> to the word qualified, then came to be also used in <em>apposition</em> to it, and finally was placed after it like an adjective. The consequence of the appositional, and finally adjectival, construction was, that for numerals connected with feminine nouns a special shorter form came to be used, whilst the original forms, with the abstract feminine ending, were used in connection with masculine nouns, after as well as before them.</p>\n<p>On this view the historical process would have been that originally the abstract numerals (like Latin trias, decas, Greek πεντάς, δεκάς, &c.) were placed in the constr. st. before masculines and feminines alike, e.g. שְׁל֫שֶׁת בָּנִים trias filiorum, עֲשֶׂ֫רֶת נָשִׁים decas mulierum. A trace of this earlier usage was seen in the examples, like שְׁל֫שֶׁת נָשִׁים.  Further, it was possible to say שְׁלשָׁה בָנִים trias, sc. filii, as well as בָּנִים שְׁלשָׁה filii, trias. From this second appositional construction it was only a step to the treatment of the abstract numeral as an adjective, filii tres. Similarly the subsequently shortened forms of the abstract numeral, which were used in connexion with feminines, might stand either in the construct state before, or in apposition before or after the word numbered, thus שְׁלשׁ בָּנוֹת trias filiarum, or שָׁלשׁ בָּנוֹת trias, sc. filiae, or בָּנוֹת שָׁלשׁ filiae, trias, or adjectivally filiae tres.</p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Gesenius%27_Hebrew_Grammar/97._Numerals._(a)_Cardinal_Numbers\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Explanation 1. Hermann Solomon Reckendorf</a></strong>, 1898-98 \"Die syntaktischen Verhaeltnisse des Arabischen\" 2 vols, Brill Publishers, Leiden pp. 265-87 (also noted in Gessenius' grammar). I am combining Gessenius description of it as it is clearer and Blau's as it is more modern:</p>\n<p>He also considers that the earliest forms were abstract numerals which were placed in the construct state before the noun numbered, the latter depending on them in the genitive. The original form, however, of the abstract numerals from 3 to 9 is not the feminine, but the masculine, used for both genders, as it still is in the tens, 20, 30, &c. In other words the form had no ending (e.g. שָׁלׂשׁ), whereas BHeb עֶשׂרֵה, Ugarit 'ShRH, Arab 'AShRaT(a)- denote <em>decade</em>.  Accordingly שָׁלׂשׁ-עֶשׂרֵה means <em>three of the decade</em>, i.e. <em>thirteen</em> and the original relation between these two numerals was that of a construct noun and a governed noun. The feminine abstract numeral was first distinguished by a special form in the numbers from 13 to 19 when connected with masculines, and this distinction was afterwards extended to the numbers from 3 to 10. This explanation does not affect the view stated above that the appositional and adjectival use of the abstract numerals was only adopted later in addition to their use in the genitive construction.</p>\n<p>The differentiation of the numerals (originally of common gender) into masculine and feminine forms in the second decade, was occasioned, according to Reckendorf, by the use of the עֶשְׂרֵה form in compounds, which felt to be abstract feminine due to ending ה, and similarly Ugaritic <em>-h</em>, Arabic <em>-at</em>. So long as it was felt that שְׁלשׁ-עֶשְׂרֵה simply meant the <em>three of the decade</em>, the gender of the noun numbered made no difference. When, however, the consciousness of this meaning became weakened and the combination of units and tens came to be felt as a copulative rather than a genitive relation, it seemed suitable to connect only feminine nouns with the feminine form עֶשְׂרֵה. New forms were therefore invented, both of the units and the tens, for use with masculine nouns, by <em>polariry</em>, like שְׁלׂשָה-עָשָׂר. The former, however, no longer had the form of the construct but of the absolute state, clearly showing that the consciousness of the original syntactical relation in שְׁלשׁ-עֶשְׂרֵה, &c., was lost. On the other hand, after the extension of these new formations to the first decade (single numbers), the new feminine forms readily came to be used also in the genitive construction (and therefore in the construct state) on the analogy of the earlier masculine forms.</p>\n<p><strong>Explanation 2.  Jakob Barth, 1907-1</strong>1: Sprachwissenschaftliche Untersuchungen zum Semitischen 2, pp. 1-17.</p>\n<p>He positted that the cardinals three through ten had a zero ending (i.e. were masculine). In his opinion the femminine forms שְׁלׂשָׁה and שְׁלׂשֶׁת, etc., did not originally terminate in feminine ending, but in the masculine pronomial suffix <em>-tu</em>, as preseved in the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ge%CA%BDez\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Ge'ez</a> (shalastu). Later, shalastu, etc. although it refered to masculine nouns was felt as terminating in the feminine suffix, as if feminine numbers refered to masculine nouns. In Ge'ez the feminine counterpart of the masculine pronomial suffix is -ti is only preserved in the numeral <em>two</em>: k'l'etti in contrats to masculine k'l'ettu.</p>\n<p><strong>Explanation 3. Hans Bauer</strong> 1912 paper, \"Noch einmal die semitischen Zahlwoerter\", pp. 267-70</p>\n<p>The numbers like שְׁלׂשָׁה and שְׁלׂשֶׁת do not terminate in the feminine ending. In his opinion the original ending suffix was <em>-tu</em>, however it was not a pronomial element, but was related to Arabic <em>taww</em> - single. In Hebrew we have תּוּ - <em>again</em>, <em>furthermore</em>, i.e. another single as a possible analogue. Therefore, there were two ways to denote, e.g. <em>five ships</em> (אֳנִי being <em>fleet</em>, אֳנִיָּה its <em>momen unitialis)</em>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>חָמֵש + תַוו + אֳנִי, literally <em>five + single + fleet</em>, or</p>\n<p>חָמֵש + אֳנִי + תַוו, literally <em>five + fleet + single</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>i.e. Bauer also posits that singular male noun was used to denote plurality. The first form חָמֵש + תַוו + אֳנִי got shortened to חֳמֵשֶת אֳנִי with חֳמֵשֶת referring to masculine אֳנִי. At the same time, the second form חָמֵש + אֳנִי + תַוו got shortened to חָמֵש אֳנִיָּה with חָמֵש referring to feminine noun אֳנִיָּה.</p>\n<p>Bauer similarly interprets the origin of the feminine suffix ת in nouns.</p>\n<p><strong>Explanation 4. Elmar Ternes</strong>, 2002 paper, Entgegengesetzte Genuszuweisung bei Numeralia im Semitischen: einige grammatiktheoretische und typologische Überlegungen, 719 - 36. Some other linguists also believe that this is the case.</p>\n<p>They believe that this was an archaic Proto-Semitic feature which is a residue of a more wide-spread phenomenon. No explanation is given.</p>\n\n\n",

Everything in the world is an extension of Hashem’s will. Not only did Hashem create the world but he continues to renew it every day.</p>\n<p>In Shachrit we say, “Yotzer ohr u’borei choshech.” He creates light and darkness.  Creation is an ongoing process. The world continuously exists by the active will of Hashem. This should elicit two reactions from us. The first: incredible gratitude that at every moment Hashem, out of his infinite chesed, is giving us life. The second: we have no independent existence. We cannot accomplish anything without Hashem giving us the ability to do it. In a sense, we are nothing but the expression of Hashem’s will. If a person would internalize this, there would be no place for the yetzer hara and its evil urges. Doing mitzvot and avoiding sin would become instinctual.  This is the concept of ayin, nothingness. Modern society propounds the exact opposite. The yesh, the I, is everything and man has the power to be whatever he chooses to be.</p>\n<p>Rav Levi Yitzchak explains that the blessing recited under the chupah, “Asher yatzer et hadam” referes to Hashem as the creator of man in the past tense.  Hashem left us to finish the task of self-creation. On the one hand we are ayin and on the other hand we are a yesh. We all have unique qualities and abilities which are meant to be expressed and utilized to affect and change the world. Hashem put Adam into Gan Eden l’avda, to develop it and l’shamra, and to protect it. When a person uses his wisdom guided by the Torah to think creatively, to plan and to dream, then he is a yesh. But if he just follows his physical instincts and lets his desires control him then he is an ayin, he is nothing.</p>\n<p>We can manipulate things within nature but we are limited by its laws. However, if a person makes himself into an ayin, submitting His will to Hashem, he can align himself with the Creator, who is above limitation. Then he can rise above physicality and perform miracles.</p>\n<p>These two concepts of yesh and ayin are hidden in the letters of Hashem’s name. Yud keh is the secret level of Hashem. He is concealed, distant and above nature. Vav heh parallels Hashem in this world. The vav is the connection from the outside world to this world and the heh represents this world. Performing a mitzvah affects not only this world but the hidden world too. May we merit to become partners with Hashem and to transform this world to the next world with the power of Torah.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

If so, why were there no survivors there?</p>\n\n<p>also, where did the olive branch come from if all trees were destroyed. From Israel?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 8)\n\n<p>It is a dispute in Bereishis Rabbah 33:6 whether Eretz Yisrael was flooded. According to R’ Beivai, who holds that it was flooded, the inhabitants obviously died. According to R’ Abba bar Kahana and R’ Levi, who hold that it was not flooded, there was still a massive amount of water coming in from neighboring lands; what the Midrash means is that it wasn’t flooded <em>directly</em> (see Ramban and Rabbeinu Bachaye to Bereishis 8:11, and Alshich to Bereishis 8:9). </p>\n\n<p>On to your second question. The Midrash Ibid. addresses this as well. According to R’ Abba and R’ Levi, the trees were still strong enough to avoid being knocked over. Thus, the dove got the olive branch from Mount of Olives. According to R’ Beivai, the dove flew to Gan Eden and got an olive branch from there. </p>\n\n<p>The Midrash at hand:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>מֵהֵיכָן הֵבִיאָה אוֹתוֹ, רַבִּי אַבָּא בַּר כַּהֲנָא אָמַר מִשַּׁבְשׁוּשִׁין שֶׁבְּאֶרֶץ יִשְׂרָאֵל הֵבִיאָה אוֹתוֹ. רַבִּי לֵוִי אָמַר מֵהַר הַמִּשְׁחָה הֵבִיאָה אוֹתוֹ, דְּלָא טְפָת אַרְעָא דְּיִשְׂרָאֵל בְּמַבּוּלָא, וְהוּא שֶׁהַקָּדוֹשׁ בָּרוּךְ הוּא אוֹמֵר לִיחֶזְקֵאל (יחזקאל כב, כד): אֶרֶץ לֹא מְטֹהָרָה הִיא לֹא גֻשְׁמָהּ בְּיוֹם זָעַם. רַב בֵּיבַי אָמַר נִפְתְּחוּ לָהּ שַׁעֲרֵי גַן עֵדֶן וְהֵבִיאָה אוֹתוֹ.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>TL;DR It is a matter of dispute in Zevahim whether or not Israel was inundated by the flood. According to the opinion that it was not, there is some indication that some animals and / or people survived there. Other commentators, however, and the passage in Zevahim indicate that according to both opinions everyone there died. Regarding the olive leaf, the simple assumption is that the trees simply stood. The Midrash suggests that the leaf may have been from Israel or according to another opinion, from the Garden of Eden. Other commentators suggest that the trees were destroyed everywhere and the leaf was from a newly grown tree.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>It is a matter of dispute in Zevahim (113a) whether the deluge affected Israel [i]. However Pirkei D'rabbi Eliezer (ed. Higger ch. 23) [ii] implies that it was inundated, just not directly rained on.\nThis is also clearly stated by <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chaim_Paltiel_(Paltiel_of_Falaise)\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rabbenu Hayyim Paltiel</a> in his commentary to Genesis (8:11) [iii]. This is also indicated by  and by <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nethanel_ben_Isaiah\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Midrash Maor HaAfelah</a> (Parashat Noah p. 70) and <a href=\"https://he.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D7%9E%D7%93%D7%A8%D7%A9_%D7%94%D7%91%D7%99%D7%90%D7%95%D7%A8\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Midrash HaBeiur</a> (Parashat Noah page 58) who both indicate that they are quoting Hazal that while Israel wasn't rained on, that it was inundated with water from elsewhere. Indeed, in Zevahim there (113b) [iv], both R. Yohanan who holds it didn't affect Israel, and Resh Lakish who holds it did, seem to agree that everyone other than Noah and his family died.</p>\n\n<p>However, the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hezekiah_ben_Manoah\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Hizkuni</a> (Genesis 6:14) [v] indicates that according to the opinion that Israel was not inundated that people survived there.</p>\n\n<p>Indeed, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rashi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rashi</a> to Nidda (61a) writes that in chapter Helek in Sanhedrin, it is stated that Og survived by fleeing to Israel. Evidently, at least according to the opinion that Israel wasn't subject to the flood, there were survivors there.[vi] </p>\n\n<p>Similarly, in discussing the survival of the re'em; some sort of large creature, the Talmud (Zevahim there) suggests that it survived in Israel. Accordingly, apparently at least animals in Israel could have survived. Perhaps according to this suggestion, people could have survived as well. </p>\n\n<p>As noted by Ramban (Genesis 8:11), the simple answer regarding the dove was that the trees were not destroyed. The point of sending it was to see if it was safe to exit the ark. Had the dove flown off to Israel, that would have said nothing about whether it was safe to exit.</p>\n\n<p>However, the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tobiah_ben_Eliezer\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Midrash Lekah Tov</a> (Genesis 8:11) cites two views either that it was from Israel, or that it was from the Garden of Eden:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>ומאין הביאה היונה את העלה הזה, ר' לוי אמר מארץ ישראל הביאה שלא נשטפה במבול, שכן הוא אומר ביחזקאל (יחזקאל כב כד) בן אדם אמור לה את ארץ לא מטהורה היא, לא גושמה ביום זעם... ר' קיראי אמר נפתחו לה שערי גן עדן והביאה העלה, ולמה זית, אמרה לו מוטב לי מר מזה, ולא מתוק מידך לפי שנלאו בתבה:</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Interestingly, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isaac_Abarbanel\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Abravanel</a> (Parashat Noah ch. 8) holds that neither answer is sufficient. The latter, since it is derash and not peshat, and the former, since he assumes that not only would the floodwaters have felled the trees, but even the indirect inundation that Israel received would have felled the trees! Therefore, he suggests that broken olive branches floated on top of the water, and when the water receded sufficiently some of them took root, and the dove retrieved a leaf of one of these new olive trees.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>Sources:</p>\n\n<p>[i] Zevahim 113a:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>מר סבר: ירד מבול לא\"י, ומר סבר: לא ירד </p>\n  \n  <p>One held the deluge descended upon Israel, one held it did not descend on Israel.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>[ii] Pirkei D'rabbi Eliezer (ed. Higger ch. 23):</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>חוץ מארץ ישראל שלא ירדה עליה מבול מן השמים, <strong>אלא נתגלגלו המים מכל הארצות</strong> </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>[iii] Rabbenu Hayyim Paltiel's commentary to Genesis (8:11) [iii]:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>אעפ\"י שלא ירד שם מבול מ\"מ נתגלגלו ושט(ט)פו שם המים </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>[iv] Zevahim (113b):</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>איתיביה: מכל אשר בחרבה מתו; בשלמא לדידי דאמינא ירד מבול לא\"י, משום הכי מתו, אלא לדידך אמאי מתו? משום הבלא </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>That is, even according to R. Yohanan, in Israel they were killed with \"hevel\" (apparently this means heat or hot steam). It should be noted that it seems that the Talmud and the Pirkei D'Rabbi Eliezer disagree about what killed them in Israel if it wasn't the rain.</p>\n\n<p>[v] In discussing the idea that Sihon and Og survived the flood, the Hizkuni  states that the water around the ark must not have been so hot, to explain how they survived, according to the opinion that Israel was inundated. The implication, is that according to the opinion that Israel was <strong>not</strong> inundated, that people there survived.</p>\n\n<p>[vi] Such a passage is not extant, as noted by <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maharsha\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Maharsha</a> there. See <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacob_Ettlinger\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Arukh L'Ner</a> who suggests that Rashi understood this from the passage in Zevahim.</p>\n\n\n",

An action has happened and you are quoting the action. boruch you are quoting the present state not an action. </p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Is the word 'Yahweh' (יהוה) ever uttered in jewish worship\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>I know very well that the word Yahweh (יהוה) is considered so holy by orthodox Jews that they do not dare to utter it. Even in Torah, they substitute it with either Adonai (יְהֹוָה), Hashem (השם) or Elohim (אֱלֹהִים). Furthermore, if one is well-versed in Hebrew Linguistic, significant difference in syllabus interpretation can be spotted throughout numerous passages where this word is mentioned.</p>\n\n<p>This incredible respect and discipline got me interested. My main question is:</p>\n\n<p><strong>Is there a Jewish worship ritual where this word (Yahweh) is procedurally uttered?</strong></p>\n\n<p>Because of the significance of the name both for Jews and Christians, this question is very dear and important to me. Furthermore, the almost mystical power ascribed to it by Jews fascinates me.</p>\n\n<p>Thank you for your answers in advance!</p>\n\n<p>P.S.: I'm sorry if I offended any Jewish believers by writing the Holy Name down.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>As I explain is <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/75789/reading-gods-4-letter-name/75790#75790\">Reading God's 4 letter name</a>, the vowels that we have are actually not part of the 4 letter Name. That Name is not pronounced with the consonants as written and the vowels show what to substitute for it. The vowels are a hint to the way we pronounce the name with the different consonents. Thus the vowels that are used in the transliteration that you show (A E) are not used. The transliteration used in the english word starting with J (E O A) are a hint to pronounce it as Aleph Dalet Nun Yud. In <a href=\"http://www.chabad.org/library/bible_cdo/aid/15981/jewish/Chapter-50.htm#v=4\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Yeshaya 50:4, 5, 7, 9</a> we see that the vowels used are for the pronunciation of <em>Elokim</em>.</p>\n\n<p>In any case, that particular four letter word is not necessarily the specific Name that was said in the temple (may it be speedily be rebuilt in our day). Since we do not have the temple, we cannot have the service on Yom Kippur in which the High Priest would use the Name.</p>\n\n<p>While I should note that there are those who state that the 4 letter word was not used in the Temple, I will bring some explanations that would apply if it was. Note that while it was known and used in early times (such as by Boaz), by the end of the second temple it was restricted as explained by Rav Tarfon.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>the well-known tanna Ṭarfon witnessed this ceremony; and he declares\n  that the high priest uttered the holy name of God so that his voice\n  was merged in the song of the priests (Yer. Yoma 40d, below; Ḳid. 71a;\n  Eccl. R. iii. 11)</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The talmud (as shown below) condemns the use of it.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Abba Saul (2d cent.) condemned\n  the profanation of the Tetragrammaton by classing those \"that speak\n  the Name according to its letters\" with those who have no part in\n  the future world (Sanh. 10:1);</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://jewishencyclopedia.com/articles/13542-shem-ha-meforash/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">SHEM HA-MEFORASH (Hebrew, )</a> </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>the Mishnah (Soṭah vii. 6; Tamid vii. 2) says, in conformity with this\n  interpretation: \"In the Sanctuary the name of God [in the three\n  blessings, Num. vi. 24-26] is to be pronounced in the Priestly\n  Benediction as it is written []; but outside the Sanctuary it must be\n  given the paraphrastic pronunciation [].\" The high priest spoke the\n  name of God on the Day of Atonement in his recitation of Lev. xvi. 30\n  during the confession of sins; and when the priests and the people in\n  the great hall heard him utter the \"Shem ha-Meforash,\" they prostrated\n  themselves and glorified God, saying: \"Praised be the glorious name of\n  His kingdom for ever and ever\" (Yoma vi. 2). When a very young priest,\n  the well-known tanna Ṭarfon witnessed this ceremony; and he declares\n  that the high priest uttered the holy name of God so that his voice\n  was merged in the song of the priests (Yer. Yoma 40d, below; Ḳid. 71a;\n  Eccl. R. iii. 11),</p>\n  \n  <p>Ṭarfon's account, that the voice of the high priest was drowned by the\n  song of the other priests, also confirms the synchronous statement\n  (Yer. Yoma 40b) that in former times the high priest uttered the Name\n  with a loud voice, but that subsequently, when immorality had become\n  more and more prevalent, he lowered his voice lest the Name should be\n  heard by those unworthy to hear it. The mishnah (Berakot, end)\n  mentions also an utterance of the Tetragrammaton outside the Sanctuary\n  which was permitted and even commanded, saying that \"it was ordained\n  that the name of God should be used in the ordinary forms of greeting,\n  which were the same as those exchanged between Boaz and the reapers\n  [Ruth ii. 2], or the salutation of the angel to Gideon [Judges vi.\n  12].\" According to Grätz (\"Gesch.\" 2d ed., iv. 458), this injunction\n  was given at the time of the Bar Kokba war, and the greeting, which\n  contained the Tetragrammaton instead of the word \"Adonai\" (= \"Lord\"),\n  was the shibboleth which distinguished the Jews from the\n  Judæo-Christians, who regarded Jesus also as Lord. A haggadist of the\n  third century, Abba bar Kahana, states (Midr. Teh. on Ps. xxxvi., end)\n  that \"two generations used the Shem ha-Meforash, the men of the Great\n  Synagogue and those of the period of the 'shemad' [the Hadrianic\n  persecution].\" According to Sanh. vii. 5, actual blasphemy is\n  committed only when the blasphemer really pronounces the\n  Tetragrammaton (\"Shem ha-Meyuḥad\"; comp. Sifra, Emor, xix. [ed. Weiss,\n  p. 104d]).</p>\n  \n  <p>These details indicate that the long-sanctioned dread of uttering the\n  Shem ha-Meforash was by no means without exceptions, and that the\n  correct pronunciation was not unknown. Abba Saul (2d cent.) condemned\n  the profanation of the Tetragrammaton by classing those \"that speak\n  the Name according to its letters\" () with those who have no part in\n  the future world (Sanh. x. 1); and according to 'Ab. Zarah 17b, one of\n  the martyrs of Hadrian's time, Hananiah b. Teradion, was burned at the\n  stake because he so uttered the Name. A Palestinian amora of the third\n  century (Mana the Elder) exemplified the apothegm of Abba Saul (Yer.\n  Sanh. 28b, above) by the statement, \"as, for instance, the Samaritans\n  who swear\"; he meant thereby that in their oaths the Samaritans\n  pronounce the Tetragrammaton exactly as it is written.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

There was an incorrect letter that changed the meaning of the word. The letter should have been a <em>taf</em> but was actually written as a <em>heh</em>.

Do make sure that any recipients understand the status of the scroll, and that recipients will treat it respectfully.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>If the Sefer Torah is not kosher then you burying it and according to the tradition you should put those Torah Scrolls in to the Pot made of clay (Yirmiyahu 32:14), you also say Rabbi's Kaddish and burying the scrolls</p>\n\n<p>There is no other way, this is the proper way, you burying them.

Sometimes it is not possible and may cost huge money but ther are people who will still try to save the scroll, pay for reparation  regardless the costs. I would for example take any of scrolls that was from Poland. I was born in Poland, there is not many of us Polish Jews left and we like to keep what was from Poland close and save as much as possible !</p>\n\n\n",

By staggering sowings, a constant supply of young\n  sprouts can be ensured.

    "content": "# Yesh Me'Ayin - A transformation from a state of ‘nothing’ to ‘something’\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>Recently I came across this teaching from Chassidic or Kabalistic works which apparently has something to do with our 'task' in this world:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>Hayom Yom: Tackling Life's Tasks;</em>\n<em>Translated from the writings of the Lubavitcher Rebbe, Rabbi Menachem M. Schneerson</em></p>\n<p>\"The Divine service of Jews <em>transforms yesh</em>, the self-centered perspective that pervades our material world, <em>into ayin</em>, G‑dliness\".</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I also found <a href=\"https://louisjacobs.org/encyclopedia-entries/creator-and-creation/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">this</a> teaching:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Hasidic thought follows the kabbalistic understanding of creatio ex nihilo (creation out of nothing, yesh me’ayin) in terms of the emanation of the Sefirot and the universe (of yesh, that which is) from Ein Sof (the Limitless, the Ground of Being), known as ayin (nothingness), because this aspect of deity is utterly beyond all comprehension.</p>\n<p>In some versions of Hasidism, notably in Habad, this doctrine sometimes results in a thoroughgoing “acosmism.” That is, from the point of view of G-d, as it were, there is no created universe at all. Since the universe emerges out of nothingness, its nature is to revert to nothingness so that its continued existence is possible only through the supernatural act of G-d that keeps it in being. Suspended over the void, the universe has to be created anew at every moment of time (Tanya, part II, chap. 1-7). Because creation involves the emergence of “somethingness” (yesh) from the divine nothingness (ayin), it is the task of the tzaddik to reverse the process by acknowledging God in all he does and thinks, thus restoring the somethingness of things to the nothingness whence they come (Menehem Mendel of Vitebsk, Pri HaAretz, pp. 3-4, commentary to Genesis 1:16).</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Could someone clarify for me: How it is derived from the idea that creation involves the emergence of somethingness (yesh) from the divine nothingness (ayin) that it is our task to reverse this process? i.e. to transform yesh into ayin? And what does this mean?</p>\n<p>P.s. are there any good commentaries, explanations (in English) which I could read to learn more?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>By ayin we don't mean nothing. Rather we mean the divine, which we call nothing because we don't know what it is. Were you to say ayin meant actually nothing, then you would be saying we would actually come from nowhere, which obviously won't work within religion. <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=31626&st=&pgnum=57&hilite=\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=31626&st=&pgnum=57&hilite=</a> 1/3 way up the page end of the line words וביאר הענין</p>\n\n<p>So saying our task is to transform the yesh into ayin, is exactly the same as saying make the mundane into holy = use the world to serve hashem. I think this is a basic Jewish concept. Sorry nothing Kabbalistic about this one. </p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>How it is derived from the idea that creation involves the emergence\n  of somethingness (yesh) from the divine nothingness (ayin) that it is\n  our task to reverse this process? i.e. to transform yesh into ayin?</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I assume your question is from the quote \"<strong>Because</strong> creation involves the emergence of “somethingness” (yesh) from the divine nothingness (ayin), it is <strong>[therefore]</strong> the task of the tzaddik etc\". I would answer that because \"yesh\" is not true reality, it is a hiding of G-d, a negative situation. In Chabad texts it is sometimes referred to as G-d being in exile. So it follows that one should strive to undo or reverse this state. Note that the word \"ayin/nothing\" is used since the creator is inaccessible to the creation.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>And what does this mean?</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>In Chabad philosophy (in my view) G-d's desire was for a finite (yesh) creation to achieve infinity (ayin), ending up with a <strong>coexistence</strong> of finite and infinite, this only being possible through the effort of the finite creation. In Chabad texts this is often based on the verse in Genesis \"G-d took the man, and He placed him in the Garden of Eden <strong>to work it</strong> etc\" The only path for the finite to achieve this is via performance of the Mitzvot these being the particular method G-d chose to achieve this.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>P.s. are there any good commentaries, explanations (in English) which\n  I could read to learn more</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I would start with Shaar Hayichud VeHaEmunah from Tanya, here: <a href=\"http://www.chabad.org/library/tanya/tanya_cdo/aid/7987/jewish/Chapter-1.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">http://www.chabad.org/library/tanya/tanya_cdo/aid/7987/jewish/Chapter-1.htm</a></p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>It is not a reversal. It is in reverence. Before Ein Sof created something from nothing (yesh m'ayin), a void within Ein Sof was negated (ayin m'yesh).</p>\n<p>Ayin m'Yesh is bittul of ones animal or ego (nothing from something) to create a void within us where the spark of kedusha can grow similar to how the spark of the Ohr Ein Sof created a Big Bang (Yesh M'Ayin).</p>\n<p>It is not a reversal. It is the pattern of creation playing out again in reverence and reverberating within each fragment of Adam.</p>\n\n\n",

Rabbi Yannai put on his garment on Shabbat eve and said: Enter, O bride. Enter, O bride. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>In Talmudic times there was no official liturgical piece read which signified the onset of Shabbat. Nevertheless, the rabbi(s) deemed proper to invite the Shabbat while standing as a gesture of respect. The practice was codified in the halachah (cf. Tur & SA <a href=\"https://he.m.wikisource.org/wiki/%D7%A9%D7%95%D7%9C%D7%97%D7%9F_%D7%A2%D7%A8%D7%95%D7%9A_%D7%90%D7%95%D7%A8%D7%97_%D7%97%D7%99%D7%99%D7%9D_%D7%A8%D7%A1%D7%91#.D7.A1.D7.A2.D7.99.D7.A3_.D7.92\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">262:3</a>). Later on, when much of Jewry had distinct formulas for inviting the Shabbat, we find Be'er Heitev (<a href=\"https://he.m.wikisource.org/wiki/%D7%91%D7%90%D7%A8_%D7%94%D7%99%D7%98%D7%91_%D7%A2%D7%9C_%D7%90%D7%95%D7%A8%D7%97_%D7%97%D7%99%D7%99%D7%9D_%D7%A8%D7%A1%D7%91#.D7.A1.D7.A2.D7.99.D7.A3_.D7.92\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">op. cit. 5</a>) who writes that \"we\" stand as one would for a respectable person (without mention at what particular point to stand for). Again, later on, Aruch HaShulchan (op. cit. 5) writes: </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>ועכשיו אנו אומרים לכבודה מזמורים ולכה דודי, ובחרוז האחרון עומדים וחוזרים פנינו כלפי הפתח, ואומרים: 'בואי בשלום... בואי כלה בואי כלה'.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Trans:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>And nowadays we say in her [Shabbos] honor various psalms and \"Lecha Dodi\". For the last verse, we stand and face the [synagogue's] entrance and say \"בואי בשלום וכו׳\".</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Generally speaking, there was no specific point when one must stand when inviting the Shabbat. It appears to have been somewhat similar to a matter of etiquette; stand when inviting the honorable guest. Those who have the custom to stand only for the last verse, בואי בשלום, base the practice on the Talmud (despite the fact that all other liturgy commonly recited prior to that verse was not recited in Talmudic times).</p>\n\n\n",

Breast milk is explicitly shown as being given to Yitzchak, Moshe, and Shmuel which implicitly shows that is is kosher in that the Tanach references it as a normal food. This is the case even though the source is not a kosher animal.

The reasoning of those that do not require Kiddush is since the Chachamim weren't mesakein a kiddush for those remote cases.</p>\n\n<p>We find all over in Shas that by a milsa d'lo shechiaca the Chachamim did not put their rule as in Gemarah Gittin where the Gemarah says that in a case such as two people bringing a Get since it is a remote case the Chachamim did not place the Halach of Befony Nichtav(even though if they would keep things the way they are it would naturally be subject to it).</p>\n\n<p>So too here Chachamim weren't mesakein a Halacha of Bossor Be'Cholov when it  applies in seldom cases only.    </p>\n\n\n",

The Sefer HaTerumah (82) is actually discussing the custom of some for husbands and wives not to pass anything back and forth when she is a nidda. The Sefer HaTerumah notes that Ri demonstrated that that certainly is not the halakha. According to the halakha, only wine is forbidden. Then he mentions the Midrash Tanna D'Bei Eliyahu quoted by some as a proof that nothing may be passed and concludes that even the Midrash isn't proof, as it might only be referring to food items. However, he never says that he is disagreeing with his mentor Ri, and asserting that the halakha is that any foods may not be passed. Indeed, he concludes that avoiding passing things in general is a good custom and makes no distinctions. Lastly, he is talking about passing, whereas Shakh extends this to presenting him with something.</p>\n\n\n",

And her neighbors and relatives heard that the Lord had shown great mercy to her, and they rejoiced with her. And on the eighth day they came to circumcise the child. And they would have called him Zechariah after his father, but his mother answered, “No; he shall be called John.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Luke 2:21-39 English Standard Version (ESV)</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>And at the end of eight days, when he was circumcised, he was called Jesus, the name given by the angel before he was conceived in the womb.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Did a priest or rabbi come to the home to perform the circumcision?  Were there formal traditions or prayers recited, and if so, what do we know about them and how do we know about them?  What is the English translation for a typical prayer or blessing said at circumcision?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>According to <em>halacha</em> (Jewish law), a father is obligated to circumcise his son on the eighth day after birth (unless some health reason requires postponement).  The circumcision is to be done by the father or an agent he appoints; there is no requirement that the person performing the ritual be a rabbi, priest, or any other special category.  Today it is customary to hire a <em>mohel</em> to do it, but that is a matter of expertise -- most people today do not know how to do it safely.  (We also tend to hire agents to do other specialized things, like writing a torah scroll and slaughtering animals for meat.  <em>Halacha</em> does not require hiring a specialist; practicality usually does.)</p>\n\n<p>The torah records one case of a woman performing circumcision (Moshe's wife Tzippora circumcised their son on the way to Egypt in Exodus chapter 4).  Under the Greek ban on circumcision c. 215-163 BCE, <a href=\"https://www.myjewishlearning.com/article/a-history-of-brit-milah/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Antiochus degraded and executed mothers of circumcised babies</a>, which makes me think the mothers might have sometimes done the act themselves.  Usually, though, I believe either fathers or agents hired by fathers were the ones to perform circumcision throughout our history.</p>\n\n<p>The Mishna, the part of the talmud compiled around 200 CE, talks about <em>when</em> to perform circumcision, but I haven't found anything there about <em>where</em>.  Today the circumcision can be held either in the synagogue (typically right after morning services) or in the home.  A celebratory meal is part of the <em>mitzvah</em>, so practicality might govern the choice sometimes.</p>\n\n<p>The one performing the circumcision says a <em>b'racha</em> (blessing) before doing so: \"Blessed are you, Hashem our God, King of the universe, who sanctifies us with <em>mitzvot</em> and commands us concerning circumcision\".  The father also makes a <em>b'racha</em> before the circumcision: \"Blessed... and brings him (the son) into the covenant of Avraham our father\".  In some traditions the father also says <em>Shehechiyanu</em>, a <em>b'racha</em> expressing thanks for reaching this time.  (It's not specific to circumcision; this prayer is also said on festivals, when donning new clothes, when eating a type of fruit for the first time in a year, and other occasions.)</p>\n\n<p>See the <a href=\"http://halachipedia.com/index.php?title=Brit_Milah\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Halachipedia page on circumcision</a> and its many citations for more on the <em>halacha</em> as we have it today.</p>\n\n\n",

The Rambam wrote in his\ncommentary on the Mishnah (Shabbat chap. 23 and quote in the Beit\nYosef Orach Chaim 307) that it is forbidden to read books of wisdom,\nwhich are not Torah, on Shabbat and Yom Tov. This is interesting since\nthe Rambam is usually thought to be the authorities most open to\ngeneral wisdom. But according to the Ramban (Beit Yosef ibid.), it is\npermissible to read medical books since they contain wisdom.</p>\n<p>These two\nopinions at quoted in the Shulchan Aruch (ibid. #17): \"It is forbidden\nto study on Shabbat and Yom Tov aside from words of Torah, and even\nbooks of wisdom are forbidden, and there is an opinion which permits\nit.\" The Mishnah Berurah (380:65) indicated that we act leniently but\nit is proper to be strict.</p>\n<p><strong>The basic halachah is therefore that it is\npermissible to learn secular subjects on Shabbat but it is certainly\nproper to be strict. If one follows the permissible view, it includes\nschool reading or studying for a test on the condition that one enjoys\nit. If such activities cause stress and fear over a test, one should\nrefrain from studying.</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.dailyhalacha.com/m/halacha.aspx?id=598\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">DailyHalacha</a> writes</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The Shulhan Aruch (Orah Haim 307:17) writes, “It is forbidden on\nShabbat and Yom Tob to study anything besides words of Torah; even\nscholarly matters are forbidden. But there is [an opinion] that allows\nit” (listen to <a href=\"http://www.dailyhalacha.com/m/halacha.aspx?id=598\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">audio recording</a> for Hebrew citation).</p>\n<p>The first view\nrecorded in the Shulhan Aruch forbids reading all secular material,\nincluding scholarly textbooks, whereas the second view – which is the\nposition taken by the Rashba (Rabbi Shelomo Ben Aderet of Barcelona,\n1235-1310) – permits studying “Dibreh Hochma” – works of scholarship.\n(This is also the position of the Ramban.)</p>\n<p>There is a general rule that when the Shulhan Aruch records two views\nin this fashion (“Setam Va’yesh”), he accepts the first opinion as the\nHalacha. Accordingly, it would be forbidden to read or study any\nsecular material on Shabbat or Yom Tob, including secular textbooks.</p>\n<p>The question arises as to whether this would apply to consulting a\nmedical textbook for guidance in treating an ill patient on Shabbat.\nIf, for example, a doctor is called upon to treat a patient on\nShabbat, would he be allowed to review material in his medical\ntextbooks for verification? For that matter, if a child is sick, may a\nparent consult a medical guidebook to determine how to best treat the\nchild?</p>\n<p>Hacham Ovadia Yosef, in his work Halichot Olam, writes that in such\ncases one may rely on the lenient view of the Rashba, who, as we saw,\npermits studying secular subjects on Shabbat. Since there is a\nparticular need to study the material in question, we may, under the\ncircumstances, rely on the Rashba’s position. Hacham Ovadia applies\nthis ruling even to a medical student who will be taking an exam after\nShabbat. Given the present need to review the material, the student\nmay rely on the lenient view of the Rashba and study for his exam on\nShabbat.</p>\n<p>This discussion should alert us to the importance of devoting our free\ntime on Shabbat to Torah study. Even when it comes to reviewing\nmedical information, Halacha permits this study only on the basis of\nthe minority view of the Rashba. Certainly, there is no room to permit\nreading novels and other unnecessary material on Shabbat, and\nreviewing one’s bills and other financial papers is most definitely\nforbidden on Shabbat.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Is one allowed to study for a parsha test on Shabbat?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p><a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/q/86582/5275\">This question</a> addresses whether one may read secular material on Shabbat. All the answers indicate that it is permissible to learn Torah on Shabbat.</p>\n\n<p>A common \"Rebbe technique\" used for years in yeshivot is to give parsha or Gemara tests on Sunday morning. This causes students and parents to study for the test on Shabbat. I understand that Shabbat is meant for עונג (loosely translated - pleasure  / enjoyment) and one should avoid doing things that upset him or cause stress on Shabbat. So, the question is if one can study Torah specifically for the Sunday test when such activity is stressful?</p>\n\n<p>Years ago, I asked one of my son's rebbes this question. His answer was something to the effect of using the adage (forgot where it comes from):</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>מתוך שלא לשמה בא לשמה</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I.e., ideally people should learn Torah for the sake of the Mitzvah of learning it. However, if people learn Torah <strong>without</strong> this reason (e.g. either positively, such as if you give kids a prize for learning or negatively such as giving a test) this forms a habit where, eventually they will learn it just for the mitzvah. Essentially, the rebbe used this as explaining why it's OK to study for the Sunday test.</p>\n\n<p>I'm curious if this reasoning is valid for overriding the requirement of עונג שבת.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>Shmiras Shabbos Khilchosa 28:84 says that one can study for a test of Limudai Kodesh on Shabbos as the Mitzva to study Torah is applicable on Shabbos. Due to that when one is studying for a Limudai Kodesh test on Shabbos they are fulfilling a need of Shabbos. This is mentioned by the issue of Hachana. The fact that there is no mention limiting this to one who enjoys learning is a clear indication that there is no such issue and that even one who is stressed by learning may do so on Shabbos.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: -1)\n\n<p>Assuming for the sake of argument that studying for a stressful Torah test would be a violation of <em>oneg Shabbat</em> I see two reasons why it might nevertheless be permissible.</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>It might be akin to fasting on Shabbat in the event that one has a bad dream. Although this detracts from the Shabbat experience, it is permissible (Shabbat 12b, Rambam's Hikhot Taaniyot 1:12). The Sefer HaOrah (Hilkhot Taanit Vol. I:71) indicates that although sub-optimal (according to some, one should fast to make up for fasting on Shabbat), it is the right thing to do in spite of <em>oneg Shabbat</em>, since if one didn't fast one would be (even more) uncomfortable since one is nervous about the dream, and the fast will help:</li>\n</ol>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>דקיימא לן כל היושב בתענית קורעין לו גזר דינו של שבעים שנה עונג הוא הוא לו כשמתענה וקורע גזר דינו, שאם אין מתענה יושב ודואג כל היום כולו ואינו נהנה בעונג שבת מפני הפחד</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>This is similarly indicted by Rashi to Ta'anit (12b s.v. Vaafilu) and by R. Hai Gaon, and \"most commentators\" referenced by Rashba (Berakhot 31b), and by Tur (OH 288) who write that in this case, it is considered <em>oneg Shabbat</em> for him to fast since it will relieve him.</p>\n\n<p>Similarly, in our case it could be argued that in event that one will be nervous and uncomfortable anyway, given the looming test, and studying will alleviate the tension, that one would be allowed to study. (Whether or not this would apply even if one could've done it earlier, is debatable.)</p>\n\n<ol start=\"2\">\n<li>Another reason is based on Rif's understanding of a passage in Shabbat (19a) regarding riding on boats on Shabbat. Rif (Shabbat 7b) explains that it is forbidden since the motion ruins one's <em>oneg Shabbat</em>, but the Talmud states that it is permissible for a mitsvah, since the mitsvah supersedes <em>oneg Shabbat</em>. Similarly, in our case, one might suggest that the mitsvah of Torah study supersedes <em>oneg Shabbat</em>.  One might claim, however, (cf. Tsits Eliezer 1:21) that Rif would only allow a mitsva instead of oneg Shabbat where one begin's the mitsva before the onset of Shabbat and the the mitsvah of <em>oneg Shabbat</em>, (such as where he get's on the boat before Shabbat). However, perhaps the Rif would not allow one to perform a mitsvah that would preclude <em>oneg Shabbat</em> after the onset of Shabbat.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Regarding מתוך שלא לשמה בא לשמה, that sees totally irrelevant, as why would something forbidden become permissible just because it will later become permissible. It is not even entirely clear that it is relevant. Even if one values Torah study in and of itself, he might still find studying for a test stressful.</p>\n\n<p>As always, consult a competent halakhic authority for practical issues.</p>\n\n\n",

E.g. 3 year old girl can be betrothed and a male adulterer be killed for having relations with her (she is exempt as an <em>Oneis</em> till 12); 12 year old girl and 13 year old boy are liable for capital transgressions such as Shabbos, Avodah Zara.</p>\n\n<p>I could not, however, find any obligation on a father or a mother or oneself or a <em>Beis Din</em> to keep track of someone's age.

This is because the Gemoro Makos 7a says:             </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>סנהדרין ההורגת אחד בשבוע נקראת חובלנית רבי אליעזר בן עזריה אומר אחד לשבעים שנה -<br>\n   A Sanhedrin that executes a transgressor once in seven years is characterized as a destructive tribunal. Rashi explains - If you would have done this you would have increased murder in Isreal because people would no longer fear court.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>And when we don't have <em>eidim</em> to prove his age, we cannot kill him:<br>\nKesubos 15a says:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>ספק נפשות - דיני נפשות להקל דהא והצילו העדה כתיב- במדבר לה- it is written in Bamidbar 35:\"The Congregation (sanhedrin) shall save\" - Death penalty is judged leniently when in doubt - which means until we have full proof with Eidim we cannot kill the subject to death.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>So how can we ever put someone to death?<br>\nThe answer is that when there are Eidim that know the boy has been in the world for 13 years (and 1 day) and the girl for 12 years (and 1 day) only then do we implement death penalty.<br>\nFor example the <em>eidim</em> were invited to the <em>Shalom zachor</em> (thanksgiving lechaim) the following friday night after birth on wednesday night the first citing of that boy. When this boy is 13 years and 1 day later Beis din can only now Kill him if he has שתי שערות  (two hairs of puberty), and is <em>Mechallel Shabbos</em>. Even though he is really 13 years and 3 days. The same would apply for a girl born earlier in the week and the eidim saw her at the kiddush next shabbos morning. However with regards to a woman, if she gave birth in front of eidim absolutely no proof is needed for her age (see backround info below) and she gets <em>Misas beis Din</em>. see <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Shulchan_Arukh%2C_Even_HaEzer.155.12?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Shulchan Aruch Even Haezer 155,12-14</a>:                    </p>\n\n<p>Bottom line: When there is doubt of age one is always strict e.g saphek Kiddushin requires a Gett, Saphek gittin she's ossur to Kehuna, Saphek Dinei Nefashos (i.e we have to be lenient <em>not</em> to kill them see above) we only know for sure how long he's been alive with proof of Eidim.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# No divine form for the Oral Law?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>This seriously puzzles me. The Oral Law in the form of the Mishnah (and the following Gemmorah), which is the six Sdarim, is well known, and the Gemmorah itself testifies (Shabbos 31a) its division is of divine origin.<br>\nHowever, when Rambam wrote his Mishne Torah, he chose a completely different Seder of 14 tractates. Next came HaTurim and made it into four, with his own subdivisions.   </p>\n\n<p>So does it mean the Oral Law does not have a fixed divine structure as the written Torah?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>In explaining a statement of Rambam, his son Rabbenu Avraham explains (Exodus 24:12) that when the Midrash speaks of the Mishnah being Sianaic, it doesn't mean that there was a set formula for it, or that all the details in it were transmitted, but rather that <em>ideas</em> were transmitted. Indeed, in his introduction to his commentary to the Mishnah, Rambam discusses R. Yehuda HaNassi's motivation for structuring the Mishna as he did, and nowhere does he indicate that this was divine rather than R. Yehuda HaNassi's idea:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>כאשר חשב לחבר את הספר הזה לפי תכנית זו, ראה שצריך לחלק אותו לחלקים, ולכן חלקו לששה חלקים</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Accordingly, presumably, he would <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/a/53351/8775\">reject the aggada</a> in Shabbat, or more likely, <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/a/11995/8775\">explain it homiletically</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Regarding the structure of the Mishneh Torah and Turim, the Turim is not really equivalent to the Mishna in that it skips everything not practically relevant today anyway. Regarding the structure of the Mishneh Torah, Rambam himself states (Introductino to Sefer HaMitsvot) that he considered using the Mishnaic structure, but ultimately decided that his categorisation system would be more practical:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>וכאשר כוונתי בדעתי התכלית הזאת שמתי מחשבתי באי זה פנים אחלק החבור ושעריו איך ראוי שיהיה. אם אחלקהו כמו חלוק המשנה ויספיק לי דרכו, או אחלקהו חלוק אחר ואקדים ואאחר לפי מה שיחייב העיון שהוא היותר ראוי והיותר נקל ללמוד. ונראה לי שהטוב שתהיה חלוקתו שיושם הלכות הלכות מקום המסכתות מהמשנה עד שיאמר בו הלכות סוכה הלכות לולב הלכות תפילין הלכות מזוזה הלכות ציצית. ושאחלק כל כלל לפרקים והלכות כמו שתעשה המשנה. עד שיהיה דרך משל בהלכות תפילין פרק ראשון ופרק שני ופרק שלישי ורביעי וכל פרק נחלק להלכות כדי שיהיה נקל לדעת אותו על פה למי שירצה או לזכור דבר ממנו</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>While he respects the Mishnaic division enough to initially consider it, he makes no suggestion that the system is divine. Even had he believed that there was divine inspiration in the Mishnaic system, it doesn't change his point that it is not the most useful for his purposes. </p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>Interestingly, the Tosafot Yom Tov does chide another Mishnaic commentator for changing the order of the Mishna. Importantly, the context seems to be a commentary on the Mishna itself; not a separate halakhic work like the Mishneh Torah, or the Turim:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>נקטינן בסידורן כדאיתא פרק במה מדליקין דף ל\"א. אמר ריש לקיש מאי דכתיב והיה אמונת עתך חוסן ישועות חכמת ודעת וגו'. אמונת. זה סדר זרעים. עתך. זה סדר מועד. חוסן. זה סדר נשים. ישועות. זה סדר נזיקין. חכמת. זה סדר קדשים. ודעת. זה סדר טהרות ע\"כ. והנה אחרי שחכמים הגידו סדרן. תמיהני איך מלאו לבו של בעל כף נחת להפוך הסדר. ונזיקין שהוא רביעי לדבריהם ז\"ל לאחרונה יסע לדילוגו. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

I couldn't find any definition.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 6)\n\n<p>A <em>mamzer</em> (bastard) is born from an illegal (forbidden) marriage or adultery. However, regarding a gentile, BT (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Sotah.26b.8?with=all&lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Sot. 26b</a>) states:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>דאמר רבי יוחנן משום רבי ישמעאל מנין לעובד כוכבים ועבד שבאו על הכהנת ועל הלוייה ועל בת ישראל שפסלוה שנאמר (ויקרא כב, יג) ובת כהן כי תהיה אלמנה וגרושה מי שיש לו אלמנות וגירושין בה יצאו עובד כוכבים ועבד שאין לו אלמנות וגירושין בה</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Rashi concludes (based upon another beraita in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Sanhedrin.52b.22?with=all&lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">San. 52b</a>) that a gentile does not retain matrimonial status. </p>\n\n<p>This said mamzer is prohibited from joining the Jewish nation (<a href=\"https://he.m.wikisource.org/wiki/%D7%A9%D7%95%D7%9C%D7%97%D7%9F_%D7%A2%D7%A8%D7%95%D7%9A_%D7%90%D7%91%D7%9F_%D7%94%D7%A2%D7%96%D7%A8_%D7%93#.D7.A1.D7.A2.D7.99.D7.A3_.D7.90\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">SA, EH 4:1</a>). However, we find further on (<a href=\"https://he.m.wikisource.org/wiki/%D7%A9%D7%95%D7%9C%D7%97%D7%9F_%D7%A2%D7%A8%D7%95%D7%9A_%D7%90%D7%91%D7%9F_%D7%94%D7%A2%D7%96%D7%A8_%D7%93#.D7.A1.D7.A2.D7.99.D7.A3_.D7.9B.D7.90\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">op cit. 4:21</a>) that a child born from a non-Jewish incestuous relation is not considered a <em>mamzer</em> and is permitted to join the Jewish nation. This would demonstrate that a child born from a relationship which under Jewish law would be considered illegal would <em>not</em> be considered a <em>mamzer</em> because mamzeirus does not apply to illegal unions of gentiles. </p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>No. There is no concept of mamzerut applicable to gentiles. This is noted <a href=\"https://www.yeshiva.org.il/ask/89328\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a>, for example. Similarly, they are not listed  in chapter 12 of Rambam's Hilhkot Issurei Biah which relates to which converts can marry other Jews. The closest thing I am aware of to to mamzerut among non-Jews is a view on the Yerushalmi (cited by Ohr Sameah to Hilkhot Issurei Biah 12:19) that the product of a non-Jewish mamzer and a Jewish woman would be considered a mamzer. This relates to relationships with other Jews though; not between non-Jews.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>A gentile cannot be a Mamzer as the sifri Says on the Passuk Devarim 23,3, Yevamos 76b and also Yerushalmi Kidushin 3,4:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>לא יבא ממזר בקהל ה':מום זר.<br>\n  What is a Mamzer? an acronym for Moom zor i.e foreign blemish.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The Ramban on the passuk explains:                                </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>ממזר: שם לאיש מוזר מאחיו ויודעיו שלא יודע מאין בא כדברי רבותינו בקדושין ירושלמי פ\"ג הי\"ד אמר ר' אבהו מהו ממזר מום זר -<br>\n  i.e a person who is <strong>different amoung his</strong> <strong>brothers</strong> and people who know him, because they don't know which father he comes from, Like rabbi Abbahu says a \"Moom zor\" i.e foreign blemish. It is implied from here that there is no gentile Mamzer because he is completely a Zor(alien) whereas a mamzer means he is a complete jew among his brothers with a defect called a \"moom zor\" (foreign blemish) that we don't know who fathered him.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>An alternative explanation is given by the Malbim:                       </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>או שהוא מום שהוא זר לבני ישראל, שאין מצוי ביניהם שיולד ע\"י איסור ביאה. כמאמרם ז\"ל, \"אחד היה בהם, ופרסמו הכתוב\" -<br>\n  The reason why \"Moom zor\" Foreign blemish only applies to Jews is because it is uncommon for adutary or insest amoung them that a child should be born from such a union, As our Rabbis said: \"only one was amoungst them and the Pasuk  publicised who he was (i.e the son of Shlomis bas Divri at the end of Parshas Emor). However gentiles are more prone to prohibited relationships to a point that it cannot be considered a foreign blemish for them therefore Mamzer doesn't apply to them since it is so common.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The Mishna in Kiddushin says (66b) a mamzer can only happen with Jewish parents כל מי שאין לה עליו קידושין אבל יש לה על אחרים קידושין הולד ממזר ואיזה זה זה הבא על אחת מכל העריות שבתורה וכל מי שאין לה לא עליו ולא על אחרים קידושין הולד כמותה ואיזה זה זה ולד שפחה ונכרית\nAnd in any case where a woman cannot marry a man, as the kiddushin does not take effect, but she can marry others (Jews), in these cases the offspring is a mamzer. This is one who has relations with any one of those with whom relations are forbidden that are written in the Torah.<br>\n And if a woman cannot marry him or with others i.e gentile or (female) slave, the offspring is like her He is not considered his father’s son at all, but has the same status as his mother.</p>\n\n<p><strong>So a gentile who cannot do Kiddushin with Jews or nonjew's cannot have mamzerim as children.</strong></p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>There is however a case of a gentile pseudo mamzer when Lot had relations with his 2 daughters and his male descendants are forbidden to marry Israelite woman forever though this is for a completely different reason as said in the torah:  לא יבא עמוני ומואבי בקהלה גם דור עשירי לא יבא להם בקהל ה עד עולם על דבר אשר לא קדמו אתכם בלחם ובמים בדרך בצאתכם ממצרים ואשר שכר עליך את בלעם בן בעור מפתור ארם נהרים לקללך An Ammonite or Moabite man shall not go in the congregation of G-d because they did not bring you bread and water when you were travelling and they hired Bilam son of Beor to curse you. Note that this is not one of the 6 arayos because Ein Av leven Noach but such a relationship is still forbidden for Jews and the children of Lot possibly were born with bad traits from such a union as it says in nedarim 20b: וברותי מכם המורדים והפושעים בי אמר רבי לוי אלו בני תשע מדות בני אסנ\"ת משגע\"ח\nThe verse states: “And I will purge out from among you the rebels, and those that transgress against Me” (Ezekiel 20:38). Rabbi Levi said: These are children of those who have nine traits, who are defective from their conception and from whom rebels and transgressors emerge. One of those traits is Irbuvia which means mixture a term used for any adulturous or incestuous relations, also shicor which means being drunk like Lot was also apllied. See Baal haturim Devarim 23,3 on the incident of Lot, where he says this idea. So we see there was an incident of a type of gentile mamzer which is prohibited to marry into klal Yisrael, but none since then.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# If a Jew violates a Rabbinically established \"fence\" on a law, is that the same as sinning against Hashem?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p><strong>This question is in no way a challenge to Rabbinical authority. This question has more to do with the philosophy of sin and how Hashem holds us accountable for our actions.</strong> </p>\n\n<p>If you commit an act which was not prohibited outright in the Torah but is an act which the Rabbis extended to protect us from sin, is that the same as outright sinning against Hashem? </p>\n\n<p>The Rabbis extending a rule to protect us would be seen as a guard against sin, right?</p>\n\n<p>So if the action is codified by the Rabbis as prohibited but it isn't considered a sin against Hashem, does Hashem hold that against you in the same way he holds a traditional sin against you? Or is the Rabbinical fence meant for the Jews to be accountable to one another?</p>\n\n<p><strong>Example:</strong></p>\n\n<p>Chicken was not historically considered equal to other forms of meat. There were debates at the time between Rabbi Akiva and Rabbi Yose Ha-Galili which argued both sides of the issue. </p>\n\n<p>They later formally expanded the rule with The Shulchan Aruch to outright prohibit the practice. </p>\n\n<p>I'm speaking to examples like this. <em>(maybe not exactly like this but the point falls into this theme)</em></p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 5)\n\n<p>According to Rambam (discussed <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/a/77689/8775\">here</a>), the obligation to listen to the rabbis is itself Biblical, on the basis of \"Do not stray from all that they tell you\" (Deut. 17:11). According to Ramban (discussed there), however, rabbinic law is not automatically Biblical. If it were, he asks, why do we find that rabbinic laws are treated more leniently? For example, a possible rabbinic prohibition is permitted, while a possible biblical prohibition is forbidden. However, elsewhere (in his commentary to Deuteronomy 4:2), even Ramban indicates that some rabbinic legislation; that which is meant as a safeguard to biblical law, is itself biblical.</p>\n\n<p>Regardless, all agree that rabbinic law is fully binding for whatever reason (see the extended discussion <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/a/77689/8775\">here</a>), and as noted some rabbinic laws may be included in Biblical law.</p>\n\n<p>Furthermore, Berakhot (4b) states (perhaps hyperbolically) that anyone who violates a rabbinic law, deserves death. S'dei Hemmed states <a href=\"https://books.google.com/books?id=KsU-AAAAYAAJ&pg=PA138&lpg=PA138&dq=%D7%A2%D7%95%D7%A0%D7%A9%20%D7%91%D7%99%D7%93%D7%99%20%D7%A9%D7%9E%D7%99%D7%9D%20%D7%A2%D7%9C%20%D7%90%D7%99%D7%A1%D7%95%D7%A8%20%D7%93%D7%A8%D7%91%D7%A0%D7%9F&source=bl&ots=3ys-eIfZcN&sig=aqa81oVY0ETmirmqLbVQ9nEtvJw&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiLtpee6pTXAhVr6YMKHZzCAawQ6AEITTAE#v=onepage&q=%D7%A2%D7%95%D7%A0%D7%A9%20%D7%91%D7%99%D7%93%D7%99%20%D7%A9%D7%9E%D7%99%D7%9D%20%D7%A2%D7%9C%20%D7%90%D7%99%D7%A1%D7%95%D7%A8%20%D7%93%D7%A8%D7%91%D7%A0%D7%9F&f=false\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a> that this means that he is liable to death at the hands of Heaven (at least in cases where it was done out of disregard for the law). Similarly, R. Hayyim Kanievsky notes that it is obvious that there is divine punishment for violations of rabbinic law (Derekh Emuna: Beiur Halakha Hilkhot Terumah 4:17). In a similar vein, R. Moshe Feinstein writes (Igrot Moshe OH 1:175) writes that one must repent if he violates a rabbinic law. The Magen Avraham (OH 334:33) states that one should fast in penitence for violating even a rabbinic Sabbath injunction. This is stated by the Elya Rabba (OH 334:26) citing the Terumat HaDeshen, as well.</p>\n\n<p>In conclusion, by all indications (according to rabbinic literature) rabbinic law is divinely sanctioned and violations thereof are not just considered an issue between two Jews, but are considered sins between man and God, although it may not be considered as severe as a Biblical sin. </p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Can a Kohen wear striped socks?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>While I tried to make the title as click-baity as possible, my question isn't limited only to striped socks.</p>\n\n<p>Some background information: One is not supposed to stare at the Kohanim when they do Birkas Kohanim, as this distracts them from paying attention to the blessing (S\"A O\"C 128:23, see Mishnah Berurah 89). For that reason, the Shulchan Aruch writes (128:30) that one who has some disfigurement on his hands or face cannot do Birkas Kohanim as it causes the people to stare at him, although if he is a regular in the town, he can say the blessing since people are used to him and won't stare.</p>\n\n<p>In the next Sif, the Shulchan Aruch writes that in locales where the disfigurements would be covered by a Tallis and the custom of the Kohanim in that community is to drape the tallis over their heads/hands, the Kohanim can go up for Birkas Kohanim. However, if the custom of the community is for the Kohanim to not drape their tallis over their hands/face, they can not start doing so in order to cover a disfigurement (Chayei Adam 32:4).</p>\n\n<p>Based on the above, my question is two-fold:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Is there a problem with a Kohen wearing 'distracting' clothing? This could be anything that is considered 'weird' (and I'm aware that what is considered weird is quite subjective, but that's beyond the scope of this question. This question is assuming that what the Kohen is wearing at the time is considered weird by the standards of that community), for example a Tallis with pictures on it, sparkly pants, or even something as simple as socks with holes.</li>\n<li>If the answer to 1 is that it is a problem, is there some timeframe where if one regularly wore 'weird' clothing that it would be considered no longer 'weird' in that locale and the Kohen can now wear it during Birkas Kohanim?</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Please note that I'm specifically looking for sources that speak out about distracting clothes. Logically, I would assume that it would be a problem as a distraction is a distraction, but I'm curious if any of the authorities explicitly speak about this.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>While my gut feeling per my understanding of Chayei Adam 32:4 was that 'distracting' clothing would prevent a Kohen from doing Birkas Kohanim, Rav Moshe Feinstein in Igros Moshe OC 2:32 (credit to @DoubleAA for the source) gives a fascinating interpretation of this law which upends the entire premise of this question.</p>\n\n<p>If I understood the Responsum correctly, Rav Moshe explains that the reason why it's forbidden for a community to start wearing a Tallis in order to allow a disfigured Kohen to do Birkas Kohanim is not because it's inherently problematic to cause people to stare. Rather, it's due to the fact that when people stare, they will realize that the person has a disfigurement and that's why the Kohanim are dressed differently. Causing staring is only problematic if there is a disqualifier that will come to light due to the staring.</p>\n\n<p>Rav Moshe also uses this to explain why Kohanim don't all have to wear uniform colored socks. Since there is no underlying disqualifier being hinted at by the different colored socks, it's not a problem if the congregation stares at it. He even goes so far as to say that a Kohen could even do Birkas Kohanim barefoot in a place where the custom is to wear socks, since there is no disfigurement being stared at!</p>\n\n<p>As a result, it would seem like there is no problem in a Kohen wearing any sort of 'weird' socks, as long as he would otherwise be allowed to do Birkas Kohanim.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>@Shmuel Brown pointed out that there is a <a href=\"https://www.yutorah.org/lectures/lecture.cfm/897680/rabbi-aryeh-lebowitz/looking-at-kohanim-during-birchas-kohanim-and-kohanim-wearing-happy-socks/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">shiur on YU Torah by R' Aryeh Lebowitz</a> that discusses this issue, and near the end of the shiur, gives 4 reasons why it would be allowed for a Kohen to wear 'Happy Socks'. The second reason given (around the 40 minute mark) is the Teshuva mentioned above from R' Moshe. It seems like the accepted opinions are that there is no problem to wear 'Happy Socks' during Birkas Kohanim.</p>\n\n\n",

If they came of their own accord, then even had he been informed by God, it ought to have said \"As God told Noah.\"</p>\n\n<p>What is the resolution. Are the statements about them coming really just a way of saying that they were brought by Noah?</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rashi\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Rashi</a> writes in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Genesis.7.9?lang=he&p2=Rashi_on_Genesis.7.9.2&lang2=he\" rel=\"noreferrer\">his commentary to (7:9)</a> that they came on their own, but this doesn't account for the contrary implication in other verses, and indeed in that very verse. </p>\n\n<p>What do other Rishonim say about this?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>In a similar vein as Rashi, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nethanel_ben_Isaiah\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Midrash Maor HaAfelah</a> (Genesis ch. 7 p. 63) quotes <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pirke_De-Rabbi_Eliezer\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Pirkei D'Rabbi Eliezer</a> (ch. 23) stating that each species's angel brought it to the ark. This is also quoted by <a href=\"https://he.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D7%9E%D7%93%D7%A8%D7%A9_%D7%94%D7%91%D7%99%D7%90%D7%95%D7%A8\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Midrash HaBeiur</a> (Parashat Noah p. 57). <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_ben_Isaac_Bekhor_Shor\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Bekhor Shor</a> similarly writes in his commentary to (7:9) that (at least the impure animals) came on their own.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abraham_ibn_Ezra\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Ibn Ezra</a> writes this as well in his commentary to (6:19). He seems to indicate that the obligation was to bring them into the ark, but that they came to the ark themselves. This would resolve the seeming contradiction. This is also clear from the commentary of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Kimhi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Radak</a> (6:19, 7:2, 7:9).</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nachmanides\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Ramban</a> (6:20) resolves the contradiction by explaining that the impure animals came on their own accord, while the pure animals were gathered by Noah.</p>\n\n<p>There are general issues with trying to reconcile modern knowledge of Earth, its geography, and the number, distribution, and characteristics of its species, with a literal account of the flood. While that is not the subject of this post, it has been noted that the species arriving by themselves (miraculously) would solve the problem of Noah gathering species from far flung places like Australia. Ramban's explanation that he gathered the pure animals himself, would be more difficult to reconcile in this regard.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>As it explains in Sefer HaYashar on the Torah for parshas Noach, beginning from the words:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>ויהי בעת ההיא וימת מתושלח בן חנוך כו״</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>It explains, like Ramban, that G-d brings the animals to Noach at the ark. It goes on to explain that G-d would cause them to circle the ark and that Noach was to sit in front of the doorway to the ark and watch them. Each pair that was led by the female and followed by the male and that lay down before Noach was to be  handed over to Noach’s sons and led into the ark.</p>\n\n<p>If the pair was led by the male and followed by the female or if they simply stood in front of Noach, they were to be rejected.</p>\n\n<p>According to the introduction to the sefer, this is a midrash that survived from the time of the destruction of the second Temple.</p>\n\n\n",

Why? Because it's a work that's essentially a combination of a midrash on older books, a compilation of extra-biblical works and commentary on older books. It's different from the other books of Tanach; it stands on the border between Tanach and Tanachic commentaries. For this reason it was placed at the end, as if to say: \"Until here - Tanach, and from here on - commentary.\" (a little like <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Shabbat.31a.6?vhe=William_Davidson_Edition_-_Vocalized_Aramaic&lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Hillel's famous teaching</a>).</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moshe_Garsiel\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Prof. Moshe Garsiel</a> in <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WL7SVgr0ak8\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">this lecture</a> argued that the last great frontier the Jewish leaders were faced with during the final days of the Tanachic era was the issue of: \"Who is a Jew?\". This came about due to the continuous clashes and conflicts between the Jews that returned from the diaspora and the Samaritans. The Samaritans claimed they were the successors (whether spiritual, biological or both) of the Kingdom of Israel, which was a <em>separate nationality</em> than the Kingdom of Judah. Same religion, different ethnicity. Later, upon being rejected from Temple worship, they went on to claim that the real place chosen by Hashem was actually Mt. Gerizzim in the Shomron. This, of course, worsened the dispute. According to Garsiel, Divrei Hayamim was written as an anti-Samaritan polemic. It emphasizes the parts of Jewish history that disprove Samaritan claims and does not includes material that may be used by the Samaritans to prove their point. In short, Ezra and Nechemiah record the first several clashes between the two groups. As a reaction to what is described there, DH was written to assist in the \"war effort\", so to speak.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Which verse is correct? Genesis 1:14 or Leviticus 23:27?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>Genesis 1:14 says that all Appointed Times (מועדים) are determined by the Sun and the Moon Phases. For example, all Holy Meetings (מקרא קדש) in the 1st or 7th months fall on moon phases.</p>\n\n<p>However, Leviticus 23:27 says that Yom Kippur is on the 10th which does not fall on any moon phase.</p>\n\n<p>So which verse is correct? Genesis 1:14 or Leviticus 23:27?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>You are mistaken as to the meaning of the pasuk. The months are determined by the moon. That is each month starts with the beginning of the month at the declaration of the new moon by the Sanhedrin (or by the fixed calendar based on the moon nowadays). Thus the Torah stating that Yom Kippur is the tenth day of the seventh month shows that it starts based on the relationship of the moon (which declares the start of Tishrei - the seventh month).</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saadia_Gaon\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rav Saadya Gaon</a> translates ul'moadim in 1:14 as 'times', rather than festivals. (Tafsir there).</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yosef_Qafih\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rav Qafih</a> explains (notes there) that rav saadya gaon's point is that holidays are not solely dependant on heavenly bodies. Rather, in his opinion holidays follow days of the month which are primarily defined by calendrical calculations.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Targum_Onkelos\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Targum Onkelos</a> similarly renders it 'times'. This is also the understanding of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abraham_ibn_Ezra\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Ibn Ezra</a> (there).</p>\n\n<p>Furthermore, even if it meant that the constellations determine holidays, it could mean that the festivals follow the day of the month, but the months themselves could be based on the moon. Thus the moon is still the determinant. That is, the holiday would be some number of days after the new moon.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>The Hebrew word for month is חדש which literally means 'newness' (i.e. being new). That is, a Hebrew \"month\" is simply a calculation of days in terms of the new moon (an occurrence that happens to take place 12 times a year).</p>\n\n<p>Yom Kippur occurring on the tenth of the <em>month</em> is thus by definition tied to the calculation of the moon.</p>\n\n\n",

    "title": "What were they thinking following contradictory leniencies in Challah 4:7?",
    "content": "# What were they thinking following contradictory leniencies in Challah 4:7?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>Among other places, the following Braisa appears in Eruvin 6b:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>לעולם הלכה כבית הלל והרוצה לעשות כדברי בית שמאי עושה כדברי בית הלל עושה מקולי ב\"ש ומקולי ב\"ה רשע מחומרי ב\"ש ומחומרי ב\"ה עליו הכתוב אומר (קהלת ב, יד) הכסיל בחשך הולך אלא אי כב\"ש כקוליהון וכחומריהון אי כב\"ה כקוליהון וכחומריהון</p>\n  \n  <p>Really, the Halacha follows Beis Hillel.  However, one who wishes to hold like Beis Shammai may do so; like Beis Hillel, he may do so; like the leniencies of Beis Shammai and the leniencies of Beis Hillel, he is wicked; like the stringencies of Beis Shammai and Beis Hillel, regarding him the passuk says, “The fool goes in darkness.” Rather, if like Beis Shammai, in their leniencies and their stringencies; if like Beis Hillel, in their leniencies and their stringencies. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>In explaining this Braisa, the Gemara (Ibid. 7a) says:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>אמר רב שיזבי כי לא עבדינן כחומרי דבי תרי היכא דסתרי אהדדי כגון שדרה וגולגולת דתנן השדרה והגולגולת שחסרו וכמה חסרון בשדרה בש\"א שתי חוליות וב\"ה אומרים חוליא אחת ובגולגולת בש\"א כמלא מקדח וב\"ה אומרים כדי שינטל מן החי וימות ואמר רב יהודה אמר שמואל וכן לענין טריפה</p>\n  \n  <p>Says Rav Sheizbi: When do we not so like two opposing stringencies? When they contradict each other, like the case of the spine and skull, as we taught in a Mishnah: </p>\n  \n  <blockquote>\n    <p>The spine and the skull that are missing [fragments don’t impart tumah by being in the same room - Rashi]. How much must be missing from the spine [to be subject to this leniency]? Beis Shammai say: two vertebrae. Beis Hillel say: one vertebra. And in the skull? Beis Shammai say: a drill hole. Beis Hillel say: enough that were it taken from a live person, they would die. </p>\n  </blockquote>\n  \n  <p>And Rav Yehudah said in the name of Shmuel, they likewise argue by treifah. [An animal is only a treifah if it meets these same requirements - Rashi.]</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Rashi elaborates:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>ומאן דעביד בטריפה כבית הלל וכבית שמאי במת הוי כסיל דהא סתרין עובדי אהדדי דהכא הוי חסרון והכא לא הוי חסרון</p>\n  \n  <p>One who does by a Treifah like Beis Hillel and like Beis Shammai by a dead person is a fool, for these opinions contradict each other: here this measurement is considered “missing” and here this measurement is considered “missing.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>That is to say: where the <em>reasons</em> of the opinions contradict, we may not hold of two opposing stringencies or leniencies. </p>\n\n<p>Now look at Challah 4:7 (brackets are adapted from Bartenura):</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>יִשְׂרָאֵל שֶׁהָיוּ אֲרִיסִין לְנָכְרִים בְּסוּרְיָא, רַבִּי אֱלִיעֶזֶר מְחַיֵּב פֵּרוֹתֵיהֶם בַּמַּעַשְׂרוֹת וּבַשְּׁבִיעִית, וְרַבָּן גַּמְלִיאֵל פּוֹטֵר. רַבָּן גַּמְלִיאֵל אוֹמֵר, שְׁתֵּי חַלּוֹת בְּסוּרְיָא. וְרַבִּי אֱלִיעֶזֶר אוֹמֵר, חַלָּה אֶחָת. אָחֲזוּ קֻלּוֹ שֶׁל רַבָּן גַּמְלִיאֵל וְקֻלּוֹ שֶׁל רַבִּי אֱלִיעֶזֶר. חָזְרוּ לִנְהוֹג כְּדִבְרֵי רַבָּן גַּמְלִיאֵל בִּשְׁתֵּי דְרָכִים: </p>\n  \n  <p>A Jew who sharecrops a non-Jew’s field in Syria: R’ Eliezer obligates its produce in Ma’aser and Shemitah [like Eretz Yisrael], and R’ Gamliel exempts [like outside Eretz Yisrael]. R’ Gamliel requires two Challos in Syria [one to be given to a Kohen and one to be burned, like outside Eretz Yisrael], and R’ Eliezer requires one Challah [like Eretz Yisrael]. They grabbed hold of the leniencies of R’ Gamliel and R’ Eliezer, but then retracted to hold like the words of R’ Gamliel in both cases. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>At first, they held of opposing leniencies - contradicting themselves as to whether it was considered Eretz Yisrael or not - and then retracted to hold that it is like Chutz LaAretz in all aspects. </p>\n\n<p>The Bartenura explains that one who holds of opposing leniencies is a wicked person - Tosfos Yom Tov notes that he gets it from the above discussion in Eruvin - and so they retracted to hold like a single authority. </p>\n\n<p>So what were they thinking at first? Did this teaching, that one is wicked for holding of opposing leniencies, suddenly materialize in the middle of this discussion? Why wouldn’t they hold of this teaching originally? Why did they need to retract and they didn’t just hold like one opinion the entire time?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>As you noticed, they indeed changed the halacha to follow Rabban Gamliel in all cases, as Rav Kahati explains.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>(עיין בבלי עירובין ו, ב; ז, א) לפי שאין לאחוז שתי קולות הסורות זו את זו</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The reason as to why they initially accepted the kulos of both was because the two kulos appeared to be dealing with different areas of halacha. That is, one was speaking about sharecroppers working for gentiles and the halachos of <em>sh'viis</em> and <em>ma'aser</em>. The other halacha deals with a Jew baking bread and having to separate <em>challah</em>. Since this appear to be two completely different areas of halacha, then one can follow the leniencies of both without worrying. However, on further analysis, they realized that the basic reason behind this halacha was whether the halachos of <em>Suriyah</em> were to be compared to those of ארץ ישראל or not. Once this analysis was made, then they wanted to avoid even the appearance of contradiction.</p>\n\n<p>Rav Kahati explains this in his introduction to the mishnah.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>כבר ביארנו (דמאי ו, יא; מעשרות ה, ה) שארצות ארם שכבש דוד המלך וסיפחן\n  לארץ ישראל נקראות בתלמוד \"סוריה\" ואין דינה של סוריה כדין ארץ ישראל לכל\n  דבר, שהואיל ודוד כבש אותה קודם שנכבשה כל ארץ ישראל, לא נתקדש כקדושת\n  הארץ; ואמנם יצאה מכלל חוץ לארץ, אבל לכלל ארץ ישראל לא הגיעה. מכאן, יש\n  דברים שסוריה היא בהם כארץ ישראל, ויש דברים שהיא בהם כחוץ לארץ.</p>\n  \n  <p>We already explained (Demai 6, 11; Ma'asros 5, 5) that the lands of\n  Aram conquered by David HaMelech and attached to Israel were called in\n  the Talmus \"Suriah\" and the laws of Suriah are not like the laws of\n  Israel in all matters,Since David conquered it before the entire Land\n  of Israel had been conquered, it did not get the full sactity of the\n  Land; Therefore it left the general category of <em>Chutz La'Aretz</em>, but\n  it did not enter the general category of the Land of Israel. There are\n  matters in which Suriah is like <em>Eretz Yisrael</em> and matters in which\n  it is like <em>chutz La'Aretz</em>.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Originally, those discussing this thought that they could treat each section of the mishnah as an independent halacha and have a different conclusion for each one (the leniencies of both) without a contradiction. However, on further analysis, they realized that both Rav Eliezer and Rabban Gamliel were explaining that the two areas of kedusha were to be considered similar. As a result, the underlying psak as to whether they were to treat Suriah as Eretz Yisrael or Chutz La'aretz had to be the same for these areas. Now that this was concluded, the rule of not following contradicting leniencies applied.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 2)\n\n<p><a href=\"https://he.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D7%99%D7%A6%D7%97%D7%A7_%D7%91%D7%9F_%D7%9E%D7%9C%D7%9B%D7%99_%D7%A6%D7%93%D7%A7\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">R. Yitshak ben Malkitsedek of Simponto</a> explains in his commentary to the Mishna there that indeed, originally they followed the leniencies of both, but in the course of time, they learned the teaching that one who follows the leniencies of both is considered bad, and therefore adjusted their practice.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>יש לומר על כן חזרו דתניא העושה כבית הלל והרוצה לעשות כבית שמי עושה כקוליהון וכחומריהון, אבל העושה כקולי בית שמי וכקולי בית הלל רשע, כחומרי בית שמי וכחומ' בית הלל עליו הכתוב אומר והכסיל בחשך הולך, <strong>ומעיקרא דנהוג לא שמיעא להו ובתר דשמיעא להו הדרי בהו</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>See also Hazon Ish Shvi'it (4:7) who asks this question ans discusses it.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Removing Mold off bread on Shabbos\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>Is it permitted to remove mold from bread on shabbos?</p>\n\n<p>Aside from the issue of Borer, is it also an issue of Tolesh? Ie. Just like removing or picking up a mushroom from the ground is assur(which is a a fungus, and grows on the ground) is considered telisha (Shmiras shabbos kehilchasa 26:10)\nSo too shouldn’t removing the mold from the bread also be considered telisha?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Rabbi Ribiat in 39 Melachos, Volume 2, page 281, Shemiras Shabbas\n  KeHilchasa 26:10, Rambam Hilchot Shabbat 7:4, 8:3. explain that the\n  Melacha of Kotzer refers to detaching produce from the ground using a\n  utensil such as a sickle.</p>\n  \n  <p>Tolesh which is the Toldah of Kotzer, includes detaching produce from\n  the ground with one's hands. Uprooting or severing any part of a\n  living plant is forbidden on Shabbat under the category of Kotzer.</p>\n  \n  <p>There is a discussion amongst the Poskim, if Kotzer applies to things\n  which do not grow from the ground.</p>\n  \n  <p>Minchas Chinuch Kotzeir 2 asserts that the opinion of Rambam is that\n  Kotzeir is not limited to Gidulei Karka, and this seems to fit with\n  the Gemara Shabbos 107b that pulling a fetus out of its mother’s womb\n  is an act of Okeir Davar M'Gidulo. The Talmud Yerushalmi Shabbos 48b\n  takes this to an extreme and says that pulling a fish out of water is\n  an act of Kotzeir M'Doraisa. </p>\n  \n  <p>However the Magen Avraham (340:15) seems to imply that Kotzeir only\n  applies to things that grow from the ground. While the Magen Avraham\n  isn't discussing Kotzeir, he does write that all of the Melachos are\n  learned out from the Mishkan and since we hold that dosh is limited to\n  Gidulei Karka, the others must be as well.</p>\n  \n  <p>Ramban Shabbos 107b also insists that Kotzeir is limited to Gidulei\n  Karka. He rejects the proof from the fetus case, claiming that the\n  Gemara sometimes uses the phrase “Okeir Davar Migidulo” with regards\n  to other Melachos, in this case: Netilas Neshama. He further asserts\n  that the Bavli disagrees with the Yerushalmi about fish. In fact, he\n  suggests that even Rebbi Yehudah who holds that Dosh applies to things\n  that don’t grow from the ground would agree that Kotzeir only applies\n  to Gidulei Karka, since the ground is such an integral part of\n  Meleches Kotzeir.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Based on the above it is clear that at least some authorities will say that there is no Tolesh for something that is not connected to the ground. Even according to the authorities that say that Kotzer / Tolesh applies to things that are not connected I would venture to say that if one removes a piece of the bread together with the mold most likely there would be no issue of Tlisha.</p>\n\n<p>Thanks to <a href=\"http://halachipedia.com/index.php?title=Kotzer\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">http://halachipedia.com/index.php?title=Kotzer</a> for this answer.</p>\n\n\n### ✅ Antwort 2 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>In the Halacha Q&A section of the American Yated Ne’eman (28 Cheshvan 5778, Nov. 17, 2017) this <em>exact</em> question was asked to Rav Azriel Auerbach Shlit”a, (The Rav of Bayit V'gan in Jerusalem, and son of Rav Shlomo Zalman Auerbach זצ\"ל). What follows is the answer printed there:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Meleches Kotzer involves removing something from its life source (Rambam Shabbos 7:4). While this certainly applies to plucking plants from the ground, it also applies to items that are not attached to the ground, such as picking mushrooms or removing moss from the side of a bucket (Shulchan Aruch 336:5). Although your question is a valid one, removing the mold from the bread does not present a problem of Kotzer. In order to understand this, we must explain a subtle concept in Halacha. Even though scientists may describe mold as growing on the bread, this does not change the Halacha. Chazal considered something to be growing if it grows like a plant, such as wheat, trees, or even the moss you described, even funguses such as mushrooms are considered like growing plants and present an issue of Oker Davar Migidulo. Mold however is not viewed as a growing plant, since it starts off as a microscopic entity, and even when it develops it is not similar to plants or fungus as it spreads and does not consider it to be  growing and, therefore we cannot call removing it to be Oker Davar migidulo. However I believe that removing this mold does constitute a problem of meleches borer, because the mold and the bread are two clearly distinct entities. Therefore you should cut off a small part of the bread from under the mold in order to remove it.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>The Melocho of Kotzair is defined as the uprooting or severing of a plant from its source of growth. Upon the cutting of the fruit from its tree any potential of future growth is eradicated. Even a Flower attached to its flower pot in your living room is subject to Kotzair as it has the criteria discribed in Masechet Shabbos page 95'which is that its drawing life from its soil.Removing a Fish from the water strips him of his source of life and is therefor according to some considered Kotzair.</p>\n\n<p>Considering a moldy piece of bread,if he took off the mold with a tiny piece of the bread as is required by some authorities in order to evade the Melocho  of Borer (according to the understanding that it is not Borer since it is the Derech Achilah of this bread), the moldy part will continue and grow moldier ,and would therefore surely not be considered Tolaish since the mold will continue to grow on that piece of the bread.</p>\n\n<p>However even if he hadn't taken it off with a piece of the bread the mold still contains a tiny particle of the bread (which in itself would not solve the problem of Borer since that tiny speck of bread can not be considered Ochel for it is certainly not edible) which would still continue growing and therefore can not be considered Borer.</p>\n\n<p>Therefore removing the moldy part shall not be considered Tolaish or Kotzair.  </p>\n\n\n",

If there is someone in the family who is occupied with Torah\n  study, he takes precedence over a stranger.

Furthermore, by employing someone who is involved in Torah or\n  a poor person who has children to support, the deceased will acquire\n  more merit.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>And indeed one can find a number of societies who will say Kaddish on behalf of departed Jews, e.g., <a href=\"https://www.chevrahlomdeimishnah.org/learning-lzecher-nishmas/learning-lzecher-nishmas-services/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Chevrah Lomdei Mishnah</a>, <a href=\"http://kupathrabbimeir.org/t-kaddish.aspx\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Kupath Rabbi Meir Baal Haness</a> and <a href=\"https://www.saykaddish.com/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">saykaddish.com</a></p>\n\n<p>Anyone can hire someone to say <em>Kaddish</em> so I assume that who does it depends on the specifics of each situation.</p>\n\n\n",

Furthermore, the very same wording that is used here in the promise to Avraham \"גוי גדול; great nation\" is used in God's promise to Jacob upon his descent to Egypt (Genesis 46:3). Evidently, it was not considered fulfilled at the time of their descent. Indeed, the verse describing their becoming a great nation (Deut. 26:5), refers to their time in Egypt:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>וַיָּ֥גָר שָׁ֖ם בִּמְתֵ֣י מְעָ֑ט וַֽיְהִי־שָׁ֕ם לְג֥וֹי גָּד֖וֹל </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>So, to recap, the question is, why does God tell Avraham to go to Canaan, and continue to say that he will make Avraham into a great nation, if they did not became a great nation in Canaan, nor is there any obvious direct connection between going to Canaan and later becoming a great nation in Egypt.</p>\n\n<p>While he doesn't seem to be directly addressing this point (but rather the word לך), Rashi (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Genesis.12.1?lang=bi&p2=Rashi_on_Genesis.12.1.1&lang2=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">12:1</a>) seems to assume that the nationhood would occur in the place where Avraham was told to go, and assumes that this means the beginning of becoming a nation, which is Avraham having children. He suggests that Avraham couldn't have children earlier, but would in Canaan, so the beginning of his becoming a great nation was in Canaan:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>שָׁם אֶעֶשְׂךָ לְגוֹי גָדוֹל, כָּאן אִי אַתָּה זוֹכֶה לְבָנִים</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Hizkuni (later quoted by R. Hayyim Paltiel and Perush HaRiva) and Radak write similarly (in their commentaries to 12:2). Tol'dot Yitshak (Genesis 14:13) seems to have absorbed Rashi's understanding (that the nationhood is assumed in Canaan) that he repeatedly quotes it as part of the verse:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>וזהו שאמר לך לך מארצך וממולדתך אל הארץ אשר אראך ושם אעשך לגוי גדול </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The Netsiv suggests (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Genesis.12.2?lang=bi&p2=Haamek_Davar_on_Genesis.12.2.1&lang2=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">commentary to 12:2</a>) that becoming a great nation refers not to his progeny, but to others gathering around him (which could have occurred in Canaan). However, this is somewhat unsatisfactory for as noted, all inferences from Scripture suggest that the promise was not fulfilled until they reached Egypt.</p>\n\n<p>The Ohr HaHayyim writes that he was given three blessings corresponding to the three steps he took (leaving his land, birthplace, and father's house). Accordingly one might suggest that the blessings have nothing to do with going to Canaan. However, this isn't so satisying textually and is more of a derash, (and it isn't even clear that according to him the blessing are random, and the only connection is the number.)</p>\n\n<p>What are other solutions to this? Is the nationhood perhaps unrelated to Canaan? Is it perhaps a reward for going to Canaan that may occur out of Canaan? Is there some more direct causal link between Avraham's journey to Canaan and their ultimate nationhood?</p>\n\n<p>I am seeking peshat based answers, rather than Midrashic answers. I didn't find anything else in Rashi, Rav Saadya Gaon (Tafsir), Ibn Ezra, Ramban, Bekhor Shor, Daat Zkenim, Tur's commentary, or Seforno.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>I'm not proposing a specific answer, just throwing out a number of thoughts related to this topic, hopefully which will help answer some of the questions posed above.  My current comments pertain to your suggestion \"Is the nationhood perhaps unrelated to Canaan?\"  If I ever get around to it, I will try to tackle some of the other angles, but this is what I have for now.</p>\n\n<p>(Note that all of the Mefarshim I am using are from <a href=\"http://mg.alhatorah.org/Full/Bereshit/12.2#e0n7\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">this link</a>.)</p>\n\n<p>It could be suggested that the context implies that the \"leaving\" is what will allow him to begin become a great nation, not arrival in a certain place (as perhaps emphasized by the fact that the destination is not named at this time).  This may be part of the understanding of many of the Mefarshim.</p>\n\n<p>Rasag here makes the connection you mentioned between this Beracha and the later Pesukim which mention a \"Goy Gadol\", obviously not believing that it takes place in Canaan:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>והדבר שעליו נופל הדיבור ואעשך לגוי גדול הוא:\n  א. רבוי המשפחות ומספרן, ככ׳: ויהי שם לגוי גדול עצום ורב.\n  ב. והענין השני בזה, שבניו יהיו נענים בקראם אל אלהים, ככ׳: מי גוי גדול וגו׳.\n  והג׳, שנתן להם את התורה ומצוותיה, ככ׳: ומי גוי גדול אשר לו חקים ומשפטים צדיקים ככל התורה.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>He also explains previously why this whole Beracha would have been said to Avraham at this time:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>ונאמר, לא הקדים לו את כל ההבטחות אלא כדי שיבואו עליו תחלה צרות ויקבלם בבטחון, וירבה לו שכר על כך.\n  והרי אנו רואים:\n  א. שבנגוד להבטחה ואעשה אותך לגוי גדול לא הוליד, ככ׳: ״ותהי שרי עקרה״...\n  ב. ונגד מה שאמר לו: ואברכך – היה רעב בארץ,\n  ג. ובנגוד להבטחה ואגדלה שמך, אמר לו פרעה: ״למה אמרת אחתי היא״. וכדומה לזה דברים שאירעו לו... ולא עוד אלא שגורש – ״ויצו עליו פרעה אנשים״, וכל אלו אירעו לו למרות ההבטחות, וכשקיבל {הכל} בסבלנות נתקיימו ההבטחות בו ובזרעו בכפליים. ולפי רעיון זה, היתה, יראתו את השם גדולה מכל אלה שהלכו עמו, כי להם לא הובטחו דברים שלא נתקיימו {בתחילה}.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>A version of Ibn Ezra here suggests another understanding of \"Goy Gadol\" that happened in Canaan, one that may not immediately come to the mind of a Jewish reader, namely, that Avra(ha)m himself had 8 children, who all had children and grandchildren of their own:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>לגוי גדול – שמונה משפחות הוליד.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Feedback is welcomed, and IY\"H one day I will hopefully come back to add to this.</p>\n\n\n",

(one definition of this term is:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>רבנו חננאל, מסכת ברכות דף מב. ואמר כיון שהזכיר רב ששת פת הבא בכיסנין,\n  פירש זו הפת העשויה כמין כיסין מלאים סוכר ושקדים ואגוזים וכיוצא בהן…\n  Rabbenu Hanan’el, Commentary to Masekhet Berakhot 42a And it says that\n  when Rav Sheshet mentions pat haba bekisnin, he explains this as bread\n  that is made like a type of pocket that is filled with sugar, almonds,\n  walnuts, etc…</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The above definition sounds like a pastry or \"turnover\". However, it defines filling with sweet items or nuts.</p>\n\n<p>I'm not sure if this definition would be applied to a deli roll which seems to be shaped similarly (i.e., it is a \"filled\" dough.)</p>\n\n<p>There is also a generally accepted rule among most current <em>poskim</em> stating that regardless of the shape / form, if the food is normally eaten as a meal and not a snack, one would have to wash and say \"hamotzi\", anyway. I'm not sure what the status of a deli roll is.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>I think that this answer from <a href=\"http://dinonline.org/2010/11/07/deli-roll/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">dinonline</a> (excerpts) covers all the angles of the multiple definitions of pat haba bekisnin as it applies to deli roll:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Poskim dispute whether or not a meat filling renders a food pas haba\n  bekisnin. However, I understand that the deli roll is usually eaten as\n  an appetizer, or snack. Assuming this is the case, all would concur\n  that it has the status of pas haba bekisnin.  It is true that the\n  principle of filled pastry applies first and foremost to sweet\n  fillings. According to Taz (168:6), it applies even to fillings of\n  meat, whereas Magen Avraham (168:16) writes that a meat filling would\n  not change the berachah from hamotzi to mezonos–which is the opinion\n  quoted by Mishnah Berurah (168:94). However, Chayei Adam (54:5) rules\n  that bedieved one can rely on the Taz, and recite mezonos on a\n  meat-filled pastry. This would be difficult to rely on, in view of the\n  Magen Avraham and Mishnah Berurah (and Shulchan Aruch Harav). But, to\n  my knowledge, the case of the deli roll is somewhat different, because\n  it is classically served as a snack/appetizer, and not as a main\n  course or a meal. Assuming this to be true, all would agree that its\n  filling renders it pas haba bekisnin, just as in the case of sweet\n  fillings. In addition, some maintain that puff pastry is considered\n  thin/crispy and qualifies to be pas haba bekisnin (this is the opinion\n  of Yalkut Yosef), though not all agree to this. If the pastry is\n  kneaded with a maojrity part of fat/margarine (minus the water\n  content) it would also be sufficient to consider it pas haba bekisnin.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p><strong>Supplemental Note</strong> (Nissan 24, 5779): I infer from the above analysis, that a knish (any kind) would also be considered <em>pat haba bekisnin</em>. </p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Is there still a prohibition on eating from the Eitz Hadaat (Tree of Knowledge)?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>Obviously this is a philosophical question, not a practical one, but I am curious to see if anyone has commented if whether the prohibition for eating from the Eitz Hadaat still stands today.</p>\n\n<p>On the one hand, it would seem that the reason for not eating from the Tree is moot once the first transgression happened, but on the other hand, just because the reason no longer exists doesn't mean the issur goes away. </p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>This is from logic only as I have not seen a discussion other than those who discuss what would have happened had Adam managed to refrain from eating the fruit. One could say that the fact that it is not mentioned again after the chait, implies that it was no longer relevant. Indeed, the only reason given for the expulsion and the guarding of the Garden is the <em>Aitz Hachaim</em>. Apparently, there was no problem if Adam would have eaten more or if he had refrained in the future from eating of the <em>Aitz Hadaat</em>.</p>\n\n<p>Note that the mitzvos that apply to both Bnai Noach and Bnai Yisrael are only those that were repeated at Sinai. Those that were given before Har Sinai and not repeated were applied only to Bnai Yisrael. (Artscroll Sanhedrin 59a3). Aitz Hadaat was never mentioned and therefore would have been one of the 613 mitzos in the same way that <em>gid hanashe</em> is applied only to Bnai Yisrael (Art Scroll Sanhedrin 59a3 note 23). Since it is not considered one of the 613 mitzvos, then it could not have applied to the Bnai Noach before Sinai and therefore was never applied to Bnai Yisrael by not being repeated.</p>\n\n<p>Sanhedrin 56b (ArtScroll 56b1 note 9) points out that Adam was previously allowed to eat all vegetation (and fruits in <a href=\"http://www.chabad.org/library/bible_cdo/aid/8165#v=29&showrashi=true\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Bereishis 1:29</a></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>וַיֹּ֣אמֶר אֱלֹהִ֗ים הִנֵּה֩ נָתַ֨תִּי לָכֶ֜ם אֶת־כָּל־עֵ֣שֶׂב |\n  זֹרֵ֣עַ זֶ֗רַע אֲשֶׁר֙ עַל־פְּנֵ֣י כָל־הָאָ֔רֶץ וְאֶת־כָּל־הָעֵ֛ץ\n  אֲשֶׁר־בּ֥וֹ פְרִי־עֵ֖ץ זֹרֵ֣עַ זָ֑רַע לָכֶ֥ם יִֽהְיֶ֖ה לְאָכְלָֽה:</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Thus <a href=\"http://www.chabad.org/library/bible_cdo/aid/8166/jewish/Chapter-2.htm#v=16&showrashi=true\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Bereishis 2:16</a></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>וַיְצַו֙ יְהֹוָ֣ה אֱלֹהִ֔ים עַל־הָֽאָדָ֖ם לֵאמֹ֑ר מִכֹּ֥ל עֵֽץ־הַגָּ֖ן\n  אָכֹ֥ל תֹּאכֵֽל:</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>appears to be redundant. Rav Yochanan learns that this teaches what we call the <em>Sheva Mitzvos Bnai Noach</em> and applies this to all future generations. The <em>Aitz Hadaat</em> is given explicitly in the next pasuk and is shown as not part of the previous pasuk, but a one time restriction for Adam alone.</p>\n\n<p>Art Scroll 56b2 note 16 explains why <em>Eiver min hachai</em> is shown by the אָכֹ֥ל תֹּאכֵֽל of this pasuk. It appears to me to have been repeated because the permission to eat meat was granted and Hashem wanted to avoid a misunderstanding that perhaps <em>eiver min hachai</em> was now allowed as well.</p>\n\n<p>Thus, <em>Aitz Hadaat</em> besides being impossible, and since Adam had already been made mortal for violating it, was not part of the general pasuk and therefore did not apply after the expulsion.</p>\n\n<p>We can also say that only the <em>Aitz Hadaat</em> was forbidden and any other tree of that type would have been permitted. However, we do not know if this tree was unique in the garden or if there were any more of that type. We do not even know anything about it other than it was somewhere in the Garden. The Torah does not describe it or say anything about it other than</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.chabad.org/library/bible_cdo/aid/8166/jewish/Chapter-2.htm#showrashi=true&v=17\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Bereishis 2:17</a></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>But of the Tree of Knowledge of good and evil you shall not eat of it,\n  for on the day that you eat thereof, you shall surely die.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Additionally, we see from <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/28182/would-adam-and-chava-have-been-permitted-the-tree-of-knowledge-if-theyd-waited\">Would Adam and Chava have been permitted the tree of knowledge if they'd waited?</a> that there are those who explain that Adam would have been permitted to eat from the Aitz Hadaas after Shabbat. As a result, we see that from the very beginning, this command was a temporary command, designed to last only until Shabbat. Therefore, even as it is impossible after the expulsion, it no longer would have applied after Shabbat in any case. Indeed, it was a one time test that Adam could have passed or failed, similar to Akeidat Yitzchak which was a one time event that Avraham passed.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/2568/jewish/the-tree-of-knowledge.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">The Tree of Knowledge</a></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Thus the Midrash tells us that if only Adam and Eve had waited until\n  the Sabbath, they would have been permitted to eat of the Trees of\n  Knowledge and Life, and the purpose of creation would have been\n  complete. This is an astounding concept: lf humans could follow G‑d's\n  commands on an external basis, for no apparent reason, they would\n  develop a special capacity that would enable them to fulfill their\n  potential for higher knowledge. That capacity was the ability to\n  achieve penimiut (inwardness). With this, all experience would be\n  integrated; without it, knowledge would remain external and\n  fragmentary. With it, they could indeed become like-G‑d. Without it,\n  they would remain knowledge-seeking humans.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.aish.com/tp/ss/ssw/278945171.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Bereishit 5775</a></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>There is an idea that God wanted Adam to eat of the Tree of Knowledge\n  of Good and Evil, but only after first eating from the Tree of Life.\n  Adam needed to first internalize how to properly use knowledge before\n  eating of the fruit of that tree. He could have done so by not eating\n  the fruit of the Tree of Knowledge until God allowed it. Had Adam\n  eaten of the Tree of Life by obeying God, God would have allowed him\n  to eat from the Tree of Knowledge after the first Sabbath began.\n  Eating the fruit then would not have had negative consequences.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>The prohibition is not in effect. </p>\n\n<p>The Gemara in Sanhedrin 56a-60a lists several prohibitions incumbent on Bnei Noach; a fuller treatment of this is discussed in a related answer of mine <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/a/77476/\">here</a>. The important thing to note is that the prohibition of eating the Eitz HaDaas is not on this list. </p>\n\n<p>From the fact that it’s not applied to non-Jews, we can deduce that the original prohibition did not hold; therefore, it would have to be retaught at Sinai to apply to Jews. Since it wasn’t, we can conclude that it doesn’t apply to Jews, either. </p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Deviations of Ralbag from normative Jewish theology\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>In an <a href=\"http://www.yutorah.org/lectures/lecture.cfm/704638/\" rel=\"noreferrer\">article</a> about the Rashba's views on science, <a href=\"https://www.yu.edu/riets/faculty/roshei-yeshiva/rabbi-david-horwitz\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Rabbi Dr. David Horwitz</a> throws in the following sentence (p. 53):</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><strong>No less than a radical thinker</strong> than R. Levi ben Gershom (Ralbag), <strong>who had no qualms about deviating from the normative Jewish theological position on a number of issues</strong>, was a firm believer in the effects of stars upon human life, and based his opinion on empirical evidence.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>What issues deviating from the normative Jewish theological position could he be alluding to? I don't believe the effect of stars is one of them as the author is showing how Ralbag conformed with the view of other Rishonim who argued on the <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/a/53765/1739\">view of the Rambam</a>.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 34)\n\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gersonides\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Ralbag</a> held of a number of views which might be considered problematic, or against normative theology. The first three listed below, are more deviant than the subsequent two. The former would be considered a theological anomaly (and perhaps even heretical) even in Ralbag's own milieu. The latter would probably not have caused a stir for many of the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rishonim\" rel=\"noreferrer\"><em>rishonim</em></a>, but in more recent times they might be considered outside of the standard Jewish <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hashkafa\" rel=\"noreferrer\"><em>hashkafa</em></a>. The final three are probably in their own categories, and are a bit harder to pin down.</p>\n\n<p>Note that while while each of the \"deviant\" views below might have other <em>rishonim</em> who subscribe to it as well, the factor that makes Ralbag the \"radical thinker\" is that he held of <strong>all of these</strong> \"deviant\" views.</p>\n\n<h2><strong>1) Omniscience</strong></h2>\n\n<p>Ralbag believed that God only knows what a person will do based on his natural makeup and celestial influence. However the person's free will can overpower these, and he can end up choosing something that God did not know he would choose. The entire Book 3 of Ralbag's <em><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milhamoth_ha-Shem#Milhamoth_ha-Shem_of_Levi_ben_Gershom,_14th_century\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Milchamot Hashem (Wars of the Lord)</a></em> is devoted to the topic of God's knowledge, and he discusses it a bunch of times in his commentary to the Torah as well. For example, in his discussion of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sodom_and_Gomorrah#The_Judgment_upon_Sodom_and_Gomorrah\" rel=\"noreferrer\">the destruction of Sodom</a> he writes that it would have been possible for the inhabitants of Sodom to have acted in a way contrary to how God \"knew\" they would act:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>ולזה יתכן שיהיה מה שיעשוהו האנשים זולת מה שידע ה' יתע' מסדור פעולותיהם\n  וזה כי הוא ידע פעולותיהם מהצד אשר אפשר בהם הידיעה והוא הצד אשר בו הם\n  מסודרות ומוגבלותו ואולם אשר בו הם אפשריות לא תתכן בהם הידיעה שאם הנחנו\n  שתתכן בהם הידיעה לא יתקיים שתהיינה אפשריות</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<h2><strong>2) Omnipotence</strong></h2>\n\n<p>Ralbag limited God's ability to perform miracles. According to him, a possible miracle is one where God spontaneously generates something that can exist in nature but cannot be spontaneously generated in nature. However God cannot generate something that cannot exist in nature in the first place. This is also discussed in a bunch of places. One example is his discussion by <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crossing_the_Red_Sea\" rel=\"noreferrer\">the Splitting of the Sea</a> where he gives the example that God was able to turn Moses's staff into a snake because snakes can exist in nature:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>וזה שכבר השרשנו שם שהמופתים יהיו בדברים אשר לא ימנע היותם בעצמם מצד\n  הטבע ואם היה שיהיה נמנע מצד הטבע שיהיו מאלו הסבות שיתחדשו מהם כאלו\n  תאמר כי אע\"פ שחדוש הנחש מהמטה הוא נמנע מצד הטבע הנה מציאות הנחש בעצמו\n  איננו נמנע מצד הטבע</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<h2><strong>3) Creation</strong></h2>\n\n<p>Ralbag did not believe in the standard doctrine of <em>creatio <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ex_nihilo\" rel=\"noreferrer\">ex nihilo</a></em>. Much of Book 6 of <em>Wars of the Lord</em> is devoted to this topic. He begins Part 2, Chapter 1, for instance, with: </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>It is quite clear that religious principles do not imply the belief in\n  creation <em>ex nihilo</em>. (Seymour Feldman translation)</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I discussed his view of creation at greater length in <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/a/97334/13438\">this answer</a>.</p>\n\n<h2><strong>4) Critical of the Sages</strong></h2>\n\n<p>Ralbag often criticizes the views of the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chazal\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Sages</a>. Here are a few examples:</p>\n\n<p><strong>A.</strong> The Sages state (<a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/shas.aspx?mesechta=24&daf=59b&format=pdf\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Sanhedrin 59b</a>) that God originally did not allow man to eat meat, and only permitted it later to the children of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noah\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Noah</a>. Ralbag <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/a/96321/13438\">objects to this</a> on the philosophical grounds that God's will is unchangeable, and he refers to the idea as שקר עצום ראוי שיברח ממנו כל בעל דת/דעת – a complete falsehood from which anyone with knowledge (alternatively, with religion) should flee.</p>\n\n<p><strong>B.</strong> The Sages state (<a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/shas.aspx?mesechta=23&daf=120&format=pdf\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Bava Basra 120a</a>) that <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jochebed\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Yocheved</a> was born \"between the walls\" and was thus 130 years old when she gave birth to <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moses\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Moshe</a>. Ralbag rejects this since the Torah does not publicize this, which, had it happened, would have been a greater miracle than <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sarah\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Sarah</a> giving birth to <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isaac\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Yitzchak</a> at the age of 90. He asserts that the Sages made this up in order to instill in the masses the belief in the ability of God to perform miracles. </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>וראוי שתדע כי מה שאמרו ז\"ל שנולדה בין החומות אמרו זה על דרך הדרש\n  להועיל להמון וליסד בלבם עוצם יכולת השם יתעלה לעשות הפלאים</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><strong>C.</strong> He criticizes the geometry of the Sages who state (<a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/shas.aspx?mesechta=6&daf=72b&format=pdf\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Yoma 72b</a>) that the walls of the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ark_of_the_Covenant\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Ark</a> were a <em><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biblical_and_Talmudic_units_of_measurement#Length_and_distance\" rel=\"noreferrer\">tefach</a></em> thick, noting that all the gold donated to the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tabernacle\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Mishkan</a> would not have been enough to make such thick walls.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>ולא יתכן שיהיה עובי ארנות הזהב טפח כמו שאמרו ז\"ל כי לא יתכן שישלם אחד מאלו הארונות בזה העובי מכל הזהב הנזכר באלה פקודי העשוי למלאכה וזה יתבאר למי שעיין בהנדסה עיון מעט ואולם אמרו זה ז\"ל להורות על שכבר היה לאלו הארונות עובי מורגש</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<h2><strong>5) Divine Providence</strong></h2>\n\n<p>Ralbag believed that only some people are subject to individual Divine Providence. For example in <em>Wars of the Lord</em> Book 4 Chapter 4 he writes:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Since it has been shown that it is false to say that there is no\n  individual providence at all and that it is also false to say that\n  there is individual providence operating in each and every person, it\n  is evident that individual providence must operate in some people but\n  not in others. (Seymour Feldman translation)</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<h2><strong>6) Interpreting the Torah</strong></h2>\n\n<p>While other <em>rishonim</em> had no problem ignoring or rejecting the Sages' interpretations of the Torah in favor of more <em><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peshat\" rel=\"noreferrer\">peshat</a></em>-based interpretations, Ralbag went a step further and apparently rejected the entire edifice of Rabbinic Derivations even for actual <em><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halakha\" rel=\"noreferrer\">halachos</a></em>/<em><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitzvah\" rel=\"noreferrer\">mitzvos</a></em>. He apparently thought that all <em>derashos</em> and derivations using <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baraita_of_Rabbi_Ishmael\" rel=\"noreferrer\">the 13 Principles of Exposition</a> were really <em><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asmachta_(Talmudical_hermeneutics)\" rel=\"noreferrer\">asmachtos</a></em>, with the actual law being known via tradition. In his introduction to his commentary he writes:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>והנה בביאורינו במצות ושרשים אשר מהם יצאו כל דיניהם אשר התבארו בחכמה\n  התלמודית לא יהיה מנהגנו בכל המקומות לסמוך אותם השרשים אל המקומות אשר\n  סמכו אותם חכמי התלמוד באחת מי\"ג מדות לפי מנהגם וזה שהם סמכו אלו הדברים\n  האמתיים המקובלים להם במצות התורה לפסוקים ההם להיותם כדמות רמז ואסמכתא\n  לדברים ההם לא שיהיה דעתם שיהיה מוצא אלו הדינין מאלו המקומות כי כבר\n  יוכל האדם להפך כל דיני התורה בכמו אלו ההקשים עד שאפשר בהם לטהר את השרץ\n  כמו שזכרו ז\"ל אבל נסמוך אותם אל פשטי הפסוקים אשר אפשר שיצאו הדינין\n  האלו מהם כי בזה תתיישב הנפש יותר ואין בזה יציאה מדברי רז\"ל כי הם לא\n  כוונו כמו שאמרנו שיהיה עכ\"פ מוצא הדינים ההם מהמקומות אשר סמכו אותם להם\n  אבל הם אצלם מקובלים איש מפי איש עד משה רבינו ובקשו להם רמז מן הכתוב\n  כמו שזכר הרב המורה בספר המצות ובפירוש המשנה</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Note that he does not say that he will disagree with the conclusions of the Sages. He simply objects to their methodology of deriving laws because the same methodology can be used to derive the exact opposite. Instead he formulates a list of nine premises that he will use in interpreting <em>mitzvos</em>.</p>\n\n<p>One example of the discrepancy between Ralbag's interpretation and that of the Sages is by the <em>mitzvah</em> of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tefillin\" rel=\"noreferrer\"><em>tefillin</em></a>. The Torah says to tie a sign on your hand and put <em>totafos</em> between your eyes. The Sages (<a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/shas.aspx?mesechta=30&daf=36b&format=pdf\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Menachos 36b-37b</a>) interpreted various verses to explain that the <em>tefillin shel yad</em> should be on your left hand and that the <em>tefillin shel rosh</em> should be on the upper part of the head. Ralbag, on the other hand, simply states that <em>tefillin shel yad</em> must be on the left hand since one of his premises is that all significant actions (in this case binding the <em>tefillin</em>) are done with the right hand. </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>וראוי שתדע כי התפילין של יד יחוייב שיהיו ביד שמאל וזה כי כבר אמר בהם\n  וקשרתם לאות על ידיך בפרשיות שמע ישראל והיה אם שמע ופעל הקשירה הזאת\n  יחויב שיעשה ביד הימנית כמו שהתבאר בשרשים הכוללים ולזה יחוייב שיהיו\n  התפילין של יד ביד השמאלית כי לא יתכן שנקשר אותם ביד הימנית אם יהיו\n  התפילין ביד הימנית וזה מבואר בנפשו</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Regarding the placement of the <em>tefillin shel rosh</em> <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/92684/why-are-tefillin-worn-on-the-head-and-not-between-the-eyes/92687#92687\">he simply says</a> that it can't be literally between the eyes because there is no room there, it would block your vision, and would cause the nations to mock us, which are things that the Torah would never command us.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>וכן אין הכוונה שנניח התפילין של ראש בין העינים מפני מה שאמרה התורה\n  ולזכרון בין עינך ולטוטפות בין עינך וזה כי אין שם מקום יתכן שיונחו בו\n  עם שהם יהיו סנורים בעינינו ר\"ל שכבר ימנעוהו מראית הדברים כהוגן עם שזה\n  יהיה דבר יביא אותנו להיות ללעג ולשחוק לשאר העמים והנה התורה לא תצוה\n  לעשות כמו אלו הדברים</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<h2><strong>7) Theophany at Sinai</strong></h2>\n\n<p>Ralbag also did not subscribe to the standard view of the Revelation at Sinai. According to <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maimonides\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Rambam</a> the Revelation at Sinai is the only way we know that Moshe is true and his Torah is true. As he writes in <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/rambam.aspx?rid=76\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Hilchos Yesodei HaTorah 8:1</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>משה רבינו לא האמינו בו ישראל מפני האותות שעשה שהמאמין על פי האותות יש\n  בלבו דופי שאפשר שיעשה האות בלט וכשוף אלא כל האותות שעשה משה במדבר לפי\n  הצורך עשאם לא להביא ראיה על הנבואה היה צריך להשקיע את המצריים קרע את\n  הים והצלילן בתוכו צרכנו למזון הוריד לנו את המן צמאו בקע להן את האבן\n  כפרו בו עדת קרח בלעה אותן הארץ וכן שאר כל האותות ובמה האמינו בו במעמד\n  הר סיני שעינינו ראו ולא זר ואזנינו שמעו ולא אחר האש והקולות והלפידים\n  והוא נגש אל הערפל והקול מדבר אליו ואנו שומעים משה משה לך אמור להן כך\n  וכך וכן הוא אומר פנים בפנים דבר ה' עמכם ונאמר לא את אבותינו כרת ה' את\n  הברית הזאת ומנין שמעמד הר סיני לבדו היא הראיה לנבואתו שהיא אמת שאין בו\n  דופי שנאמר הנה אנכי בא אליך בעב הענן בעבור ישמע העם בדברי עמך וגם בך\n  יאמינו לעולם מכלל שקודם דבר זה לא האמינו בו נאמנות שהיא עומדת לעולם\n  אלא נאמנות שיש אחריה הרהור ומחשבה</p>\n  \n  <p>The Jews did not believe in Moses, our teacher, because of the wonders\n  that he performed. Whenever anyone's belief is based on wonders, [the\n  commitment of] his heart has shortcomings, because it is possible to\n  perform a wonder through magic or sorcery.</p>\n  \n  <p>All the wonders performed by Moses in the desert were not intended to\n  serve as proof [of the legitimacy] of his prophecy, but rather were\n  performed for a purpose. It was necessary to drown the Egyptians, so\n  he split the sea and sank them in it. We needed food, so he provided\n  us with manna. We were thirsty, so he split the rock [providing us\n  with water]. Korach's band mutinied against him, so the earth\n  swallowed them up. The same applies to the other wonders.</p>\n  \n  <p>What is the source of our belief in him? The [revelation] at Mount\n  Sinai. Our eyes saw, and not a stranger's. Our ears heard, and not\n  another's. There was fire, thunder, and lightning. He entered the\n  thick clouds; the Voice spoke to him and we heard, \"Moses, Moses, go\n  tell them the following:....\"</p>\n  \n  <p>Thus, [Deuteronomy 5:4] relates: \"Face to face, God spoke to you,\" and\n  [Deuteronomy 5:3] states: \"God did not make this covenant with our\n  fathers, [but with us, who are all here alive today].\"</p>\n  \n  <p>How is it known that the [revelation] at Mount Sinai alone is proof of\n  the truth of Moses' prophecy that leaves no shortcoming? [Exodus 19:9]\n  states: \"Behold, I will come to you in a thick cloud, so that the\n  people will hear Me speaking to you, [so that] they will believe in\n  you forever.\" It appears that before this happened, they did not\n  believe in him with a faith that would last forever, but rather with a\n  faith that allowed for suspicions and doubts. (<a href=\"https://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/904992/jewish/Yesodei-haTorah-Chapter-Eight.htm\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Touger translation</a>)</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Standard interpretations assume that all the people experienced some prophetic revelation, and that is what makes the event at Sinai unique. Ralbag, however, asserts that the people did not actually experience a prophetic revelation. Rather, God spoke to Moshe and Moshe relayed the commandments to the people, and this was accompanied by some miraculous phenomenon that verified that God was speaking to Moshe and specifically telling him what he was repeating over.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>והנה מה שאמרו ישראל כל אשר  דבר יי נעשה היה אפשר שיובן על שני פנים\n  האחד שיהיו להם אות כי השם יתע' מדבר עמו אלו הדברים אשר יצוה אותם עליהם\n  ויהיה הרצון באמרו כל אשר דבר יי נעשה כל אשר דבר יי לך נעשה אבל רצוננו\n  שיתברר לנו שדבר ה' לך והשני הוא שיהיה הדבור דבור השם יתע' לא דבור משה\n  וזה כי אע\"פ שיתברר להם שהשם מדבר עמו הנה לא יתברר להם שיהיה הדבור אשר\n  ידבר להם משה הוא הדבור אשר דבר אליו השם יתעלה והנה לא היו ישראל סכלים\n  שירצו שידבר להם השם יתעלה בעצמו כי זה בלתי אפשר להם אבל רצו\n  שיתחדש [להם] על דרך מופת מהשם יתע' מה שיודיע להם רצון השם יתעלה\n  מזולת שישמעו זה מפי משה כמו שהכירו ענין מצות שבת מפני המן קודם שישמעו\n  זה מפי משה והנה השיב משה דברי העם אל ה' והבין אותם משה אז לפי האופן\n  הראשון רוצה לומר שהם רצו שיהיה להם אות יעיד להם כי השם יתע' מדבר עמו\n  ואז יעשו כל אשר דבר ה' לו ובאתהו התשובה מהשם יתע' לפי מה שהבין אותו\n  משה מדבריהם לסבה שזכרנו במה שקדם ואמר אליו הנה אנכי בא אליך בעב הענן\n  בעבור יראה העם בדברי עמך וגם בך יאמינו לעולם במה שתדבר להם בשמי אחר\n  שכבר יתפרסם להם שאנכי מדבר עמך והנה פירשנו אמרו בעבור ישמע בעבור\n  יראה לפי שהחושים יבואו לפעמים קצתם תחת קצת אמר ראה ריח בני וכל העם\n  ראים את הקלות וראה את ערותה וכן אמר ומתוק האור וטוב לעינים כאלו היה\n  הראות חוש הטעם או יהיה ישמע מענין הקבלה כטעם והיה אם שמוע תשמע בקול יי\n  ולא שמעו בקולי ויהיה הרצון בזה הנה אנכי בא אליך בעב הענן לעיניהם וזה\n  יהיה להם לאות שאני מדבר עמך והנה אעשה להם זה האות בעבור ישמע העם במה\n  שאדבר עמך ויקיימו הדברים ההם וגם בך יאמינו לעולם בכל מה שתדבר להם בשמי\n  מפני מה שיתפרסם להם שאני מדבר עמך והנה זה הפירוש השני יותר נכון לפי מה\n  שאחשוב וכאשר שמע זה המאמר מהשם יתעלה שב להתבונן במה שאמרו ישראל וידע\n  שהם כוונו בזה שיהיה המדבר להם השם יתעלה לא משה והנה הגיד משה דברי העם\n  אל ה' לפי זאת הכוונה השנית ולזה אמר לו השם יתע' כי מפני שהם רוצים\n  שיגיע להם קול דברים מהשם יתע' כבר יחוייב שתקדשם שלא יגשו אל אשה ויכבסו\n  שמלותם לכבוד השם יתע' כדי שיהיו נקיים מטומאות ובזה האופן יהיו נכונים\n  ליום השלישי לשמוע קול הדברים שיגיע מהשם יתע' על דרך המופת</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>In other words, it appears that according to Ralbag the Revelation on Sinai was simply a miracle like any other miracle Moshe performed. According to this, the entire proof of the truth of Moshe and his Torah is called into question.<sup>1</sup></p>\n\n<h2>8) Prophetic Inaccuracy</h2>\n\n<p>Ralbag believed that it was possible for prophets to have an incorrect understanding of the world, and that their prophecies could reflect these misunderstandings. For instance, in his commentary to Genesis 15:4 he explains that God gave Abraham a vision of numerous stars even though in reality there are very few stars, because Abraham (incorrectly) believed that there were numerous stars. Similarly God gave Ezekiel a vision in which the celestial bodies made sounds, since that is what Ezekiel (incorrectly) believed was the reality. </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>והנה מספר הכוכבים לא היה נודע בימי אברם ולזה הראהו המדמה בעת הנבואה ענין ריבוי הכוכבים למשל הריבוי המופלג אשר ייעד אותו ה' יתעלה שיהיה בזרעו וכזה תמצא שראה יחזקאל בעת הנבואה שיהיה לגלגלים קולות מצד מה שהיה מאמין מזה הענין כמו שזכר הרב המורה כי לא יחוייב שיהיו לנביא כל הדעות האמיתיות בענין סודות המציאות</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p><sup>1.Interestingly, Rambam himself in <em>Guide for the Perplexed</em> seems to explain the Revelation at Sinai in some similar way to Ralbag. In <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/97463/what-is-the-qualitative-difference-between-the-revelation-at-sinai-and-other-mir\">this question</a> I noted the difficulty of reconciling this with Rambam's statement quoted here that the Revelation on Sinai was fundamentally different from other miracles.</sup></p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 9)\n\n<p>The Rivash in his Tshuvos #45  mentioned that some of the Ralbag's beliefs that he felt were influenced by nontraditional wisdom. Rivash does mention that Ralbag wrote otherwise nice works.</p>\n\n<p>Rivash pointed to a few problematic ones in particular. One, in regard to Hashem's knowledge of the future. Two,   concerning the sun standing still for Yehoshua 'he wrote things which are assur to hear'. He also points to the beliefs surrounding understanding the soul and Hashem's involvement in punishing evildoers in this world. </p>\n\n<p>Rivash says all these problematic ideas are written in his seffer Milchamos Hashem.</p>\n\n<p>A further Tshuva in Rivash, #118, also discuses the Ralbag's opinion about Hashem's knowledge of the future. Rivash there explains the difference between Ralbag's philosophy and the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abraham_ben_David\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Ravad</a>'s whom the one posing the question thought were similar.</p>\n\n\n",

For night time, i.e. going to bed, a distinct blessing was formulated - <em>ha'mapil</em> (ibid. 60b). Naturally, as the two pieces were unique for the evening they eventually took form as a unit, recited prior to bedtime. After the Halacha was codified, two orders were popularized (cf. order of Rambam, Tefillah 7:2, Shulhan; Aruch OC 239), one was to say the KS first and then <em>ha'mapil</em>, the other was to first say <em>ha'mapil</em> and then KS. </p>\n\n<p>As it appears from your question, you follow the former. Therefore, to recite the KS (characteristically known as <em>Kriat Shema shel arvit</em>) before bedtime is fine since it is still a proper fulfillment of its evening recitation (cf. Aruch Ha'shulhan §239:5) and <em>ha'mapil</em> -in your case- is likewise still in fulfillment of the original enactment since you are reciting it at its proper time too, i.e. before bed. </p>\n\n<p>In my opinion, there is no issue -in this scenario- of \"<em>hefsek</em>\" (interruption) because <em>KS shel arvit</em> is not unique for bed since it was prescribed for <em>evening</em>, not bed. (Although the Talmud (BT, Ber. 4b) cites a prescript that it be recited when in bed, I do not believe it was meant literally, as a requirement for exactly that time, because the KS isn't unique for sleep but rather for the phenomenon as opposed to <em>ha'mapil</em> which <em>is</em> unique for sleep See Meiri Ber. 60b.) The only debatable issue of interruption would be if between a blessing proscribed on sleep and the sleep itself (or preparation of it) one were to interrupt with unrelated musings.  In any case, consult YLOR for actual practice. </p>\n\n\n",

Are they correct?</p>\n<p>The yud at the end of בני is not pronounced, it's a nach nistar.  It does sound like a yud in most Ashkenazic accents, but if the following letter was one of בגדכפ\"ת, it wouldn't have a dagesh (first example that comes to my head: בני גד and בני דן at the end of Naso).  That indicates that to the contrary, the words are supposed to be merged together.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 7)\n\n<p>(I have to correct one point: the י here isn't a Nach Nistar but an Eim Mikra, like the ה at the end of תורה, the א at the end of ברא or the ו at the end of בו. A real Nach Nistar י would definitely need to be separated, like in ‏[אדני] ימלך לעולם ועד.)</p>\n\n<p>You're certainly right that Artscroll is wrong from a classical grammar perspective. The Talmud (Berakhot 15b) already listed the cases of הפרדה בין הדבקים separating between the [sounds that] stick [together] in Shema, which are על לבבך, על לבבכם, בכל לבבך, בכל לבבכם, עשב בשדך, ואבדתם מהרה, הכנף פתיל, אתכם מארץ‏ and yours isn't on the list. R. Avraham ben HaRambam was asked about this particular exclusion in a responsum (<a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=43148&st=&pgnum=144\" rel=\"noreferrer\">79:2</a>) and answers that the י in בני isn't really pronounced like a י so there's no issue. (He does seem to indicate that if it was a Chirik instead of a Tzere it would be an issue (eg. בכורי ישראל) but that could just be his funny language used to describe the grammar.)</p>\n\n<p>That said, arguably they pronounced the Tzere vowel as less of a diphthong than is common in modern Ashkenazi Hebrew dialects which are popular among Artscoll's target audience. There is another version (in the Rif, R Amram Gaon, Sefer HaManhig, etc.) of the above cited Talmud which includes the example תזכרו ועשיתם which indicates that diphthongs do indeed count as a sound that needs to be separated. Rabbenu Yonah to the Rif there (8b) prefers our version of the Talmud though, because the final ו in תזכרו is \"נח\" quiescent. He might mean the end of the diphthong doesn't count as a sound in this regard, but he could just simply be pointing out that it's a mater lectionis and hence a clear error, without commenting on the issue of [non-native] diphthongs.</p>\n\n\n",

We return the body to the earth that is its\n  source. This is our final act of caring, and it is considered a great\n  mitzvah to physically participate in the burial. Ideally, the whole\n  grave should be filled in, by hand, by fellow Jews. Where this is not\n  possible, at least the coffin should be completely covered with earth.\n  At this point, Tzidduk Hadin is recited--a series of verses\n  acknowledging G‑d's just ways even as we confront tragedy. We then\n  recite the Kaddish and the El Malei Rachamim memorial prayer.

It is customary that direct descendants of the deceased do not\n  touch or carry the casket.</p>\n  \n  <p>During the procession, Psalm 91 is recited seven times. Beginning from\n  a short distance from the grave (approximately thirty feet), it is\n  customary to halt the procession every few feet and repeat the Psalm,\n  pausing at certain words in the final verse and reciting again from\n  the top.</p>\n  \n  <p>Before the casket is lowered into the grave, it is fitting to part with\n  the deceased and, if one has not done so earlier at the memorial\n  service, ask for forgiveness (and to forgive) for any pain or hard\n  feelings that might have come between them.</p>\n  \n  <p>Following the recitation of certain Psalms and prayers, the casket is\n  laid in the grave by the Chevra Kaddisha. It is set in the direction\n  so that the deceased's head rests where the tombstone will be erected,\n  and the feet are positioned to the front of the grave. It is then\n  covered with earth and the grave is filled until a small mound is\n  formed on top. This is followed by the recitation of \"Tziduk Hadin,\"\n  and the Mourner's Kaddish.</p>\n  \n  <p>The Chevra Kaddisha sprinkles earth from the Land of Israel into the\n  grave, as the land is holy. All the men present then fill the grave\n  with earth, beginning by covering the upper part of the casket. The\n  men can take turns, but the shovel must not be passed directly from\n  one person to the next. Instead, it is placed face down on the ground,\n  and the next person takes it, to show that this is not \"regular\" work.</p>\n  \n  <p>Some have the custom that members of the Chevra Kaddisha begin the\n  filling of the grave by scooping earth in their hands and delicately\n  placing it on the casket until it is completely covered, followed by\n  everyone else with shovels.</p>\n  \n  <p>As one fills the grave with earth, recite the following verse three\n  times:</p>\n  \n  <p>והוא רחום יכפר עוןולא ישחית והרבא להשיב אפו ולא יאיר כל חמתו</p>\n  \n  <p>He, being compassionate, pardons iniquity, and does not destroy; time and\n  again He turns away His anger, and does not arouse all His\n  wrath.</p>\n  \n  <p>It is highly preferable for Jewish men to fill in the grave. In the\n  case where there are not enough men for this task, the casket must be\n  at least completely covered with earth before allowing cemetery\n  workers to finish the job.</p>\n  \n  <p>Tziduk Hadin & Psalm 49</p>\n  \n  <p>Once the grave is completely filled with earth and the top is in the\n  shape of a small mound, a marker is placed on the grave with the name\n  of the deceased and date of passing. The prayer of \"Tziduk Hadin\" is\n  then recited. With this deeply meaningful prayer the mourners declare\n  their acceptance of G‑d's decree and pray to G‑d to have mercy upon\n  those who are living.</p>\n  \n  <p>(If Tachnun is not recited on that day, we omit \"Tziduk Hadin,\" and\n  proceed directly with Psalm 49. This also applies for a burial on late\n  Friday afternoon, or on Erev Yom Tov -- a day leading into a Jewish\n  holiday.)</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Aramaic and transliteration <a

For example, <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Yevamot.64a.9\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Yevamos 64a</a> says</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>א\"ר יצחק מפני מה היו אבותינו עקורים מפני שהקב\"ה מתאוה לתפלתן של צדיקים</p>\n  \n  <p>Rabbi Yitzḥak said: For what reason were our forefathers initially infertile?

So why the Bnei Noah are not required to \"eat\" only the clean animals? \nThanks a lot</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>Rav Hirsch explains that the animals were shown to be the ones that Noachides were going to be offering on the altar to Hashem. I would consider this to be based on the Bnai Yisrael becoming a ממלכת כוהנים. Thus, the restrictions on Bnai Yisrael as compared to the rest of the world are analogous to the restrictions on the kohanim with respect to the rest of Bnai Yisrael. This analogy would also apply to the Shabbat. Kedushah (holiness) is the separation and restriction required of the kohanim. Just as the kohanim are separated from the remainder of Bnai Yisrael, so too are the Bnai Yisrael separated from the rest of mankind.</p>\n\n<p>The point is that the animals with respect to Bnai Noach are such that the animals, when they were offered on the altar, could not be eaten. The Bnai Noach were allowed to eat any animal that had not been brought on the altar. Only certain animals were allowed on the altar, though they could be eaten if they had not been brought. Bnai Yisrael on receiving the Torah at Sinai, were raised in kedushah (holiness), so that they were only allowed to eat animals that were permitted to be brought on the altar. Animals that were actually brought on the altar were restricted even further.</p>\n\n<p>Animals that Bnai Yisrael bring on the altar are restricted even more than other animals so that certain offerings may be eaten only by kohanim, and certain others only under specific circumstances by those who brought them (Korbon Pesach and other Shelamim as examples).</p>\n\n<p>Note that Hashem did restrict the eating of flesh to an extent so as to show that it is only by the permission of Hashem <a href=\"http://www.chabad.org/library/bible_cdo/aid/8173#v=3&showrashi=true\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Noach 9:3-4</a>.

So that there must, already then, have been some occasion for\n  making this distinction, and this occasion was offerings, for\n  Noachides also were not allowed  - and are not allowed - to bring\n  other than pure animals as sacrifieces. (Zevachim 115a). So that it is\n  only that which is fit for <em>all</em> men to offer, that Jews are allowed\n  to eat. The Jewish table and the Noachian altar stand at the same\n  level.

    "content": "# Evidence of 2nd Temple Liturgy @Temple &/or Synagogue\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>Friends, I have tried & failed to find really firm documented evidence of 2nd temple period Liturgy used either in Temple services or among the Judean or extra-Judean synagogues. What I find instead, even within seminary works, is repetition of assumptions mixed with pre-2nd Temple scriptures or extra-canonical writings.</p>\n\n<p>Can someone point me to any hard evidence of form or substance of the Liturgies in use from the time of Ezra to the destructions of 70ad and 130ad?\nI do understand that the very notion of any widely accepted synagogue “Liturgy” is controversial but surely Temple proceedings were orderly.</p>\n\n<p>Links and bibliographical references are so welcome!</p>\n\n<p>Richard </p>\n\n<p>At this point [February 1 2018] it appears we won't answer this, which is about the same stopover that scholarship has take on the topic up to this point, in my observation.</p>\n\n<p>Since posting this I have read a number of Margaret Barker's works and listened to her lectures/presentations for hours - some of them 3 or 4 times to make sure I captured what she is saying. Why Barker? Because she at least acknowledges the importance of trying to connect Temple Liturgical practices to the early/primitive Christian movement's own practices. Though the outtakes or bullet points of some of her work seem to point in that direction, real source/evidence of linkage or Christian \"borrowing\" of such practices, to be incorporated into Eucharistic Liturgy, is lacking.  I still have a couple of questions outstanding to her and I am hopeful she will respond when she can. I will update this if so. Virtually all of her works except for videos/audios are referenced, and  some articles available, can be found at her site: <a href=\"http://www.margaretbarker.com/\" rel=\"noreferrer\">http://www.margaretbarker.com/</a>\n<a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Margaret-Barker/e/B001IQWG34\" rel=\"noreferrer\">https://www.amazon.com/Margaret-Barker/e/B001IQWG34</a></p>\n\n<p>I have also consulted the works of Paul F. Bradshaw <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Paul-F.-Bradshaw/e/B001IQW9E0/\" rel=\"noreferrer\">https://www.amazon.com/Paul-F.-Bradshaw/e/B001IQW9E0/</a> and will be spending a lot of hours reading more of his. But directly pertinent to my question posted here, Dr. Bradshaw guardedly [my word] indicates that evidence is not found of early Christian borrowing from Judaic practices for purposes of codifying a set Eucharistic Liturgy. Dr. Bradshaw suggests what we have in <strong>primitive</strong> days is the Didache, possibly the early forms of East Syrian Eucharistic prayers, prayers referenced in Book 7 of Apostolic Constitutions, possible primitive form of the Sanctus, and nothing else. If any of you have sourced reference to ANY other primary, primitive evidence pre-dating c.3rd Century AD, pls post. </p>\n\n<p>Here is an example of the maddening nature of the void, found in the Wiki for the East Syrian Rite, which supposedly incorporates early East Syrian Eucharistic prayers of antiquity: <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_Syrian_Rite#History\" rel=\"noreferrer\">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_Syrian_Rite#History</a>\nQuote from the section \"History\", first sentence:  \"<em>The Chaldean rite originally grew out of the Jerusalem–Antioch liturgy</em>\". There is no footnote, no reference. The other date references in the paragraph leap to the 4th century and later.  There is no sourced evidence of borrowing from Jewish sources [Temple or synagogal].</p>\n\n<p>The partial response re tefillin given below is good guidance on the topic of the Daily Hours/Canonical Hours/Opus Dei/ observances but has nothing to do with Eucharistic Liturgy so far as any extant study might show. \"The Hours\" is an important topic and in that study there is good linkage, it seems, quite directly to the Jewish Daily Prayers. Good topic for another post another time. Dr. Bradshaw, btw, has done awesome work on that topic which I am pursuing. For those interested, Dr. Bradshaw also recommends Stefan C. Reif’s book, Judaism and Hebrew Prayer, Cambridge University Press 1993 for a scholarly look at the origins of synagogue prayer and essays by Reif and by Richard Sarason in Liturgical Perspectives: Prayer and Poetry in Light of the Dead Sea Scrolls, ed. Esther G. Chazon (Leiden: Brill, 2003)</p>\n\n<p>There is no evidence that I can find that there even WAS a common worship form to Sabbath Synagogue meetings. There does seem to be an order/protocol. We have some great study done on the Synagogue emergence, very much of the scholarly work being fairly recent history, thanks to archaeological findings that ignited the area of interest. But no one has shown that the Sabbath meetings [which were not specified in the Law, BTW] had a commonly-accepted Liturgical [cap L] form. Little l, maybe so; cap L, no. Remember that the term 'liturgy' is derived from Athenian community service work usually taken on as noblesse oblige by those of higher social status. Religious adaptation of the term includes all the gods, not just one or two.</p>\n\n<p>Dr. Bradshaw's Liturgy work points out what other scholarly work triangulates, that Liturgy is largely a product of the Nicene era, not owing its form to Judaic practices. To me, that truth needs to form into a Conclusion to be written about PLAINLY. Instead we still have the echo-chamber effect of \"liturgical forms copied over from Jewish practices\". Having said that, Margaret Barker would seem to have the most keen interest in hammering out an evidence-based case for Christian Liturgy indebted to TEMPLE forms, specifically 1st/Solomon's Temple praxis. She may do so yet, but the case she set forth to this point is speculative and rather controversial. Jesus's inner-circle had no \"Liturgy\" to pass along to the downstream Christian movement. The highly-ritualized regimented forms of the old \"liturgical faiths\" is largely found rooted not in 1st century CE Apostolic or Jewish praxis but was a 'professional clerical' effort solidifying in the era of Emperor-supported Christianity.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>There are several parts of the modern liturgy (in the commonly used <em>siddur</em>) that are attributed to the Men of the Great Assembly (אנשי כנסת הגדולה), at the beginning of the Second Sanctuary era.  Many of these are referenced in the <em>Mishna</em> and the <em>Gemara</em> (Talmud), often in passing or by mere reference, implying that the actual text was well known.  Most passages have been emended through the years, so the exact original form is difficult (or impossible) to ascertain.</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><em>Baruch She'amar</em> (ברוך שאמר) is attributed to a \"note that fell from Heaven\" (possibly a reference to a minor form of prophesy) during this time period.  The number of words is significant (87), so it is likely to have changed very little.</li>\n<li>The recitation of <em>Hodu</em> (הודו, from Chronicles, and similar to Psalms 105 and 96) is a custom that goes back to King David's time, when he was hoping to bring the Ark to Jerusalem.  The custom continued afterwards, as well.</li>\n<li><em>Nishmas</em> (נשמת, also known as <em>Hallel Hagadol</em>) is (according to some) attributed to Shimon ben Shatach, from the late Hasmonean period.  It is mentioned as also being recited as part of the Passover <em>seder</em>.</li>\n<li><em>Yishtabach</em> (ישתבח) is attributed to <em>Shlomo Hamelech</em> (King Solomon), whose name is in acrostic form in the four following words.</li>\n<li>The ברכות קריאת שמע (Blessings for the <em>Shema</em>) are mentioned in the Mishna Brachos 1:4, and only their number and form are given.  The essential form of the blessings would be the same as today, and even the wording would be largely similar (though even today, there are variations among different communities).  The beginning is based on Isaiah 45:7; I believe the change from \"ובורא רע\" to \"ובורא את הכל\" (\"... and creates evil\" to \"... creates everything\") is mentioned in the <em>Gemara</em>, but I could be wrong.  The ending of גאל ישראל (\"Who has redeemed Israel\") is cited as being immediately before the <em>Amidah</em> prayer (<em>Shemonah Esray</em>), with nothing intervening.</li>\n<li>The form of the <em>Amidah</em> prayer is attributed to the Great Assembly, in <em>Megilla</em>: The number of blessings, their content and order.  (The rationale for the order is attributed to later sages, having been forgotten.  An extra blessing was also authored in Yavneh.)</li>\n<li><em>Aleinu Leshabeach</em> (עלנו לשבח) is attributed to Joshua upon the conquest of Jericho, and <em>(V')Al Kein Nekaveh</em> (על כן נקוה) is attributed to Achan after being discovered; both contain acrostics to their respective authors.  However, I don't know when it became part of the liturgy.</li>\n<li>Grace after Meals (ברכת המזון) is attributed to Moses, Joshua, and Solomon, but the text has obviously changed since.  The gist of the blessings is the same, though, and some of the original wording may survive as part of the modern variants.  (The last blessing was composed some 15 years after the Bar Kochba revolt.)</li>\n<li>I've seen the claim that most blessings commonly recited today are also attributable to the Great Assembly, specifically those mentioned in the Talmud.</li>\n<li>The triweekly public reading of the Torah goes back in part to Moses, and in part to Ezra.  The specific portions read each week were not formalized until later.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>I don't have direct sources which parts of the above were used in the liturgy during the Second Sanctuary era.  The most I can point to is the <em>Mishna Tamid</em> that mentions the <em>Shema</em> with (and without) its blessings being recited at a certain point in the daily sacrifice routine.  Those blessings would essentially be the same ones recited today (as above).</p>\n\n<p>I don't know anything about the various Christian liturgies, but I think it is unlikely that there exists any similarities between the Christian liturgies and the Jewish <em>siddur</em>.  Except for the recitation of Psalms, and even these, the connection between particular Psalm and specific occasions is likely to be tenuous.</p>\n\n<p>(I have not cited exact sources.  I'd appreciate the community's help in improving the answer.)</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>I assume that you don't refer to the description of sacrificies, because it is written in detail in the Oral Law at many places.

Firstly it comes from the word “<strong>הוֹרָה</strong>,” which means teaching. More precisely it means “teaching with direction,” i.e. the type of teaching which enables and empowers one with a direction to proceed. The same word could be used in Hebrew with such teachings both in spiritual and secular realms.</p>\n  \n  <p>The second meaning is from the word “<strong>אורה</strong>,” which means light. One\n  example of this reflected in the verse which states, “A mitzvah is a\n  candle, and Torah is the light” (Proverbs 6:23).</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Would someone please help me out to see the connection? Both hebrew words hora'ah and orah come from different roots, that's why I don't understand the connection being made. </p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>The quoted article text has been modified and no longer contains the second paragraph with the note “אורה,” which means light. Here's the current quote:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The word \"Torah\" literally translates as law or teaching. Torah is the Five Books of Moses: Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers and Deuteronomy. Each book is one-fifth of the Torah. In Hebrew, this is collectively called the Chumash (literally: fifth). It is called the Five Books of Moses because G-d dictated the text to Moses, who then wrote it down. Moses also plays a central role in the Torah. Sometimes you will see the Five Books referred to by the Greek word, Pentateuch, which means \"Five Books.\" (\"Pent\" means five, and \"teuch\" means book.)</p>\n<p>The second, more colloquial use of the term \"Torah\" includes the entire body of rabbinic literature - the Five Books of Moses, the Prophets and Writings, the Midrash, the Talmud (the compilation of rabbinic teachings explaining the biblical commandments), and even any teaching today based on these sources.\nIn this regard, Torah is the \"constitution\" of the Jewish people, covering the totality of law and lore, including lifecycle, business and medical ethics, holidays, family life, etc. So when someone says, \"I'm going to a Torah class,\" or shares a \"Devar Torah\" (word of Torah), it is usually meant in the broader sense, not the Five Books in particular.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The root of the word תורה according to ספר אמרי מדריך, which mostly follows Radak, is <strong>ירה</strong> (See verses Shemos <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Exodus.12.49?lang=bi&aliyot=0\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">12:49</a>, <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Exodus.24.12?vhe=Tanach_with_Ta%27amei_Hamikra&lang=bi&aliyot=0\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">24:12</a> among others). Interestingly, Radak in Sefer haShorashim brings the verse from <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Job.27.11?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Iyov 27:11</a></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>אוֹרֶ֣ה</strong> אֶתְכֶ֣ם בְּיַד־אֵ֑ל אֲשֶׁ֥ר עִם־שַׁ֝דַּ֗י לֹ֣א אֲכַחֵֽד׃</p>\n<p><strong>I will teach</strong> you what is in God’s power, And what is with Shaddai I will not conceal.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>which could have been a source of confusion. The New Concordance of the Bible by Abraham Even-Shoshan also agrees with the meaning of ירה as to <em>teach</em>.</p>\n<p>At the same time,  <em>Etymological Dictionary of Biblical Hebrew</em> by R. Matityahu Clark does not agree with neither of the above three sources, (אמרי מדריך, Radak, and Even Shoshan), since the root ירה also means to <em>cast, shoot</em>. He connects the word תורה meaning teaching with the root הרה which has meaning <em>implant, absorb seed</em>. R. Clark interprets his theory of cognates, so that none of the roots ירה, הרה, אור are cognates in the dictionary, despite the rules at the end of the dictionary which could entertain such a possibility.</p>\n<p>According to the New Concordance of the Bible by Abraham Even-Shoshan, <em>teaching of proper behavior</em> (הוראות להתנהגות, למוסר) is not the only meaning of the word <em>Torah</em>. It also has a meaning <em>law and rule</em> (חוק ומשפט), and as a result, the word תורה is placed separately by itself in the Concordance.</p>\n<p>Likely, connection with the word אוֹר comes from Aramaic <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Jastrow%2C_%D7%90%D7%95%D6%B9%D7%A8%D6%B8%D7%99%D6%B8%D7%99%D7%90?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">אוֹרָיָיא, אוֹרָיָיתא</a> teaching, religious instruction.</p>\n\n\n",

    "title": "How could Lot's wife have been behind Lot when looking back?",
    "content": "# How could Lot's wife have been behind Lot when looking back?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>It says in Genesis 19 that Lot had escaped to the city of Zoar, and the overthrowing of Sodom and Gomorrah did not begin until the next morning, when the sun rose. By this time, Lot was already safe with his family in the city of Zoar.</p>\n\n<p>Yet it then invokes imagery that appears to show them running, for it says Lot's wife was behind Lot when she looked back, and was turned into a pillar of salt. The questions are:</p>\n\n<p>1) Were they in motion, running, or already safe in the city? The rest of the context makes it abundantly clear nothing started until they were safe in the city of Zoar already.</p>\n\n<p>2) What does \"looking back\" mean? Does this mean anyone in the city of Zoar who looked at what was going on was also turning into pillars of salt?</p>\n\n<p>3) How was Lot's wife turned into a pillar of salt? Not through the rain from the sky, surely, because the place they were in was supposed to be untouched by this.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 3)\n\n<p><strong>1)</strong> <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malbim\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Malbim</a> addresses this by explaining that the destruction had actually began the moment they left the city. He believes this is indicated by the phrase וה' המטיר, arguing that whenever the name appears before the action it means that the action was already occurring. In this case that means that when Lot was coming to Zoar, God was already raining down destruction on Sodom.</p>\n\n<p>It is still possible to make sense of this even without accepting Malbim's view. As I noted in <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/a/96345/13438\">this answer</a> <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gersonides\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Ralbag</a>, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hezekiah_ben_Manoah\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Chizkuni</a>, and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bahya_ben_Asher\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">R. Bachye</a> citing <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abraham_ibn_Ezra\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Ibn Ezra</a> explain that it was not Lot's wife that was turned to salt, but the land was turned to salt (i.e. destroyed). Following this interpretation, we could easily understand that Lot's wife looked back once they were safe in Zoar, and she saw the land destroyed.</p>\n\n<p><strong>2)</strong> This would depend on how you interpret Lot's wife turning into salt. If, like the above mentioned commentaries, you assume that Lot's wife merely looked at the destruction then presumably anyone who looked would have also seen the destruction. If, however, you assume that Lot's wife was turned into salt as some form of direct Divine punishment, then it might have been unique to her.</p>\n\n<p><strong>3)</strong> This again would depend on your interpretation. According to some of the commentaries she <em>didn't</em> turn into salt. According to some it would have been a miraculous act of God. Still others would say that it was a natural process wherein the destruction overtook her because she tarried by looking back (but this last option doesn't really help if you assume that they were already safe in Zoar when the destruction began).</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>With regards to your second question it is brought in the <a href=\"https://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=38103&st=&pgnum=172&hilite=\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Midrash HaGadol, Bereishis 19:26</a> that a sense of compassion rose up within her over her married daughters who were in Sodom. Therefore, she looked back to see if they were following her.</p>\n\n\n",

Also please elaborate the role of Ha-Šatan in the grand scheme of things. And moreover, I am very curious as to what theological weight does the notion of 'evil' and 'the devil' bear in Judaism. For example, Satan in Christianity is pretty straight-forward, however I do not know if this is the case in Judaism. I've read all of the Scriptures but still feel like I need some guidance from someone who practices Judaism and knows it in more detail.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 8)\n\n<p>One of the fundamental results of belief that G-d is one (like is said when reciting the Shema twice a day, </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Hear Israel, the L-rd is our G-d, the L-rd is one.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>is that there is no such thing as the antithesis of G-d. There is no 'other' apart from Him like it says in Devarim 4:35. (אין עוד מלבדו)</p>\n\n<p>The Satan, the name describes literally what the function is in the grand scheme of things. שטנה means <em>to accuse</em>. The Satan serves to make accusations.</p>\n\n<p>When trying to understand the purpose behind that function, a good example is learned from the story of the binding of Yitzchok. Like was seen in parshat Vayera last week, the angel which spoke to Avraham telling him to bring Yishmael, Eliezer and Yitzchok and to offer Yitzchok as an offering to G-d at Mount Moriah was the Satan.</p>\n\n<p>The commentaries on this parsha explain that the Satan made an accusation against Avraham as a consequence of the peace agreement which Avraham made with Avimelech. It revolved around the question of Avraham's faith and trust that G-d would fulfill His promise to give all the land of Israel.</p>\n\n<p>Like with all the trials of Avraham, one aspect of each trial was to bring some trait of Avraham from a state of potential into a state of actualization and realization. In other words, for example, not just the potential character trait of being kind, but to actually demonstrate kindness. This idea of the importance of actualization is based on the general principle that <em>Action is the primary thing.</em> (המעשה הוא העיקר) Avot 1:17. And this is the explicit statement from G-d to Avraham (Bereshit 22:16) following the binding of Yitzchok and the offering of the ram in substitute.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>As a consequence <strong><em>that you did this</em></strong> thing...</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>And this idea of the function and purpose of <em>accusation</em> being connected to the Satan (in your words, <em>the embodiment of evil</em>) can also be understood from the related phrase <em>to challenge</em> (לְעַרְעֵר עַל) which in Hebrew shares the letter root for <em>evil</em> (רע).</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>The Hebrew word SATAN can also mean \"opposition\"; that is, like your opponent in a tennis match. Only with the right opponent can you achieve your fullest potential on the court. So too the game of life, God gives us these challenges and temptations in order to help us build our spiritual muscles - according to the effort is the reward. We call those moments of challenge or resistance \"the Satan\". It is an expression of God's awareness of a person's area of spiritual weakness that needs work. </p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Mezonot rolls for Se'udah Shlishit\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>I've been reading several articles that dsicuss the vague definition and debate on the exact definition of the term <em>pat haba bekisnin</em>, and how this affects, specifically what are called \"mezonot rolls\". Of specific interest is <a href=\"http://www.chaburas.org/kisnin.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">this article</a>.</p>\n<p>Of particular focus is:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>There is an easier solution to the problem, one that does not require\na knowledge of the ingredients of mezonot rolls. As we said above, one\nalways makes a HaMotzi on pat haba b'kisnin if one is eating it as a\nmeal. Mezonot rolls were invented mainly out of convenience - so\npeople do not have to wash their hands before eating at affairs or on\nairplanes. As such, their entire purpose is to be part of a regular\nmeal! As such, the entire institution of mezonot rolls collapses on\nitself - regardless of the ingredients, the general usage of such\nrolls obligates one to say HaMotzi on them.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>So, there seems to be a general agreement that regardless of how one defines the physical nature of \"mezonot rolls\", if one uses it as his meal, then one must wash and say <em>hamotzi</em>.</p>\n<p>Well, this makes me wonder of a somewhat common phenomenon. I've seen many Orthodox shuls serve \"mezonot rolls\" during <em>Seudah Shlishit</em> in shul. People do not wash (which, BTW, includes the rabbi). There is no question, in my mind that <em>Seudah Shlishit</em> is in the category of <em>kove'a seudah</em>. It is a meal!</p>\n<p>Is there something else not mentioned in that article that I'm unaware of that might allow saying <em>mezonot</em>, here? Or are all these people in error?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p><strong>Update</strong></p>\n<p>This question and answer uses the full amount of the mezonos eaten as the basis for the answer. This would also seem to apply, though you should ask the rabbi involved. Note that this also leads to the question if <em>seudah shlishis</em> <strong>requires</strong> a <em>kevias seudah</em> or not, something that should probably be a separate question. The practice cited in your question, implies that this rabbi says not, but that is a different issue.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.yeshiva.co/ask/?id=5474\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Mezonot Rolls Rabbi Ari Shvat</a></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Question:</strong></p>\n<p>What is the status of mezonot rolls? I have seen very conflicting\nopinions - some stating that they are a halachic fallacy and others\nsaying that the concept works (most notably on airplanes). Can this\nopinion be relied upon even when you are having a meal with a mezonot\nroll (kovea seudah)?</p>\n<p><strong>Answer:</strong></p>\n<p>Shalom David,<br />\nYou're right, there are different opinions regarding\n\"mezonot rolls\". For sfaradim it's simple, for the Shulchan Aruch (Or.\nCh. 168, 7) holds that as soon as the fruit juice is tasted in the\nroll (which I imagine is the case), its bracha is mezonot and doesn't\nneed washing or benching. For Ashkenazim, the Rama writes that it's\nhamotzi unless there is so much honey or spices that it's almost the\nikar (the main ingredient). The basic understanding would indicate\nthat those rolls which taste like rolls more than they taste like\ncake, are hamotzi, and accordingly, there's no such thing as mezonot\nrolls. On the other hand, others (Chabad, Maharsham) say that\naccording to th Rama, it's enough for the amount of fruit juice to be\nmore than the amount water in the batter. This does not set well with\nthe wording of the Rama and therefore is better not to rely upon. On\nplanes or when it's difficult to wash, there is on whom to rely,\nnevertheless this is less preferable. Kviat Seuda on mezonot is when\neating about 4 k'beitzim, about 8 slices of bread (some say even\nmore), something which isn't that common, so that hardly comes into\nplay here, even according to the lenient opinion.<br />\nWith Love of Israel,<br />\nRav Ari Shvat</p>\n</blockquote>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Original</strong></p>\n<p>There are those who defend the use of Mezonot rolls on a number of different issues. Rabbi Ari Enkin a resident of Ramat Beit Shemesh, is a researcher and writer of contemporary halachic issues. He is the author of the “Dalet Amot of Halacha” series (8 volumes), Rabbinic Director of United with Israel and a RA\"M at a number of yeshivot. <a href=\"http://www.rabbienkin.com\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">www.rabbienkin.com</a> posted an article with an explicit caveat. As a result, you should speak to the Rav involved to understand how he approaches this issue. Note that this article also cites the <em>kevias seudah</em> definition.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>The above is intended to serve as a “limud zechut” only. It remains the opinion of this writer that Ashkenazim should always consider\nmezonot rolls to be like any other bread requiring netilat yadayim,\nhamotzi, and birkat hamazon, regardless of any other considerations.</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>His first point is that there is indeed a difference between sefardim and ashkenazim. Additionally, since your question involves <em>seudah shlishis</em>,  which would seem to be <em>kvias seudah</em>, the issue would be more complicated than the plain usage.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.torahmusings.com/2011/01/in-defense-of-mezonot-rolls/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">In Defense of Mezonot Rolls</a></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The main difference between bread dough (“hamotzi”) and cake dough\n(“mezonot”) is that the latter is sweeter and enjoyed far more often\nas a snack rather than as a meal. According to the Mechaber, as long\nas the sweetness of the dough is merely discernable it is sufficient\nto render the product a “mezonot” item.[1] According to the Rema and\nmost other Ashkenazi authorities, however, the sweet taste has to be\nthe most dominant feature of the product.[2]</p>\n<p>The opinion the Mechaber is unequivocal. Therefore, with the exception\nof the issue of “keviat seuda” which will be discussed below, Sefardim\nand others who follow the rulings of the Mechaber are certainly\nentitled to enjoy the convenience that mezonot rolls have to offer. It\nis unclear, however, upon exactly what basis Ashkenazim who use\nmezonot rolls rely.</p>\n<p>There are those who interpret the ruling of the Rema in a manner which\nwould allow bread to be declared “mezonot” as long as the liquid\ncomponent of the dough consists of more fruit juice than water.[3]\nThis is true even if one does not taste the fruit juice in the\ndough.[4]</p>\n<p>[1] OC 168:7</p>\n<p>[2] Rema, OC 168:7.</p>\n<p>[3] Daat Torah 168:7, Shulchan Aruch Harav, OC 168:7.</p>\n<p>[4] See Shevet Halevi 8:32, 9:44 for more on this.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>However as mentioned in your question and in the cited article, <em>kvias seudah</em> is a more complicated matter. It appears according to the cited article below, that the <em>mezonot rolls</em> may be used as a result of the amount of food actually consumed at the <em>seudah shlishit</em>. This would imply that the situation that you are referring to may be regarded as not <em>kvias seudah</em>. This would depend on the actual situation there and if <em>seudah shlishis</em> requires a <em>kevias seudah</em> or not.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>There is, however, another issue which must be dealt with before\nmezonot rolls can be comfortably consumed, and that is the issue of\n“keviat seuda“, establishing a meal. According to the principles of\nkeviat seuda, one is required to perform netilat yadayim and recite\nbirkat hamazon when eating a quantity of mezonot items (“pat haba\nb’kisnin”) that one would consume if such items were in place of a\nmeal.  However, there are many different interpretations as to what is\ndefined as “a quantity” and “a meal”.</p>\n<p>According to the most lenient interpretation of keviat seuda, <strong>only one\nwho eats an amount of mezonot products which is equal to the quantity\nof bread one would eat at a normal meal is required to perform netilat\nyadayim and recite birkat hamazon. Eating an amount of mezonot\nproducts less than this will allow for one to simply recite “mezonot”\nand “al hamichya” according to this approach.[7]</strong> Such conduct is even\nbetter justified if the mezonot products are not eaten together with\nany meal-type foods.[8] Therefore, one who is served an airline meal\nwhich contains a mezonot roll should eat the mezonot roll separately,\nwith its own bracha rishona and achrona, and only then proceed to eat\nthe other foods which are served along with it.[9]</p>\n<p>Eating mezonot rolls together with meal-type foods is slightly more\ncomplicated due to the principles of keviat seuda, the details of\nwhich are beyond the scope of this paper. With regards to the common\nmezonot roll sandwich, the mezonot roll is already packaged and served\nwith the “meal-type” food, as a sandwich should be. Removing these\nitems (tuna, egg, salami?) in order to eat them separately from the\nroll as advised above is usually impractical and unappetizing.\nTherefore, it is preferable for one who is going to eat a mezonot roll\nsandwich (or pizza for that matter) to eat less than the total\nquantity of food that is normally consumed at a meal in order to\nbetter justify reciting “mezonot” on such sandwiches. However,\naccording to the lenient interpretation of keviat seuda cited above,\nas long as one eats less than the total quantity of bread that is\nnormally consumed at a meal, there will still be some justification\nfor the use of mezonot rolls along with other foods as a bread\nsubstitute.[10]</p>\n<p>[7] Aruch Hashulchan, OC 168:17; Shulchan Aruch Harav, OC 168:8; Kaf\nHachaim, OC 168:47; Igrot Moshe, OC 3:32;Yabia Omer 8:22:21.

The second pair was worn as a sign of great piety and the dispute between Rashi and R Tam revolved around which was the primary pair? The main difficulty with this approach is that the gemara doesn't discuss both pairs, nor do the Rif or Rambam. He writes that maybe, since these tefillin were reserved for people with great <em>yiras shamayim</em> who lived humble and holy lives, they were not mentioned by the gemara.</p>\n<p><strong>The second approach is that R Tam changed the accepted custom based on his understanding of the true <em>halacha</em>.</strong> He could only do this since it was a custom not explicitly mentioned in the gemara. That was the opinion of Michtav M'Eliyahu (4:25) who writes \"Certainly there has been an accepted practice, but because there was no precise <em>mesorah</em>... this remains a custom. Torah Law requires that the ruling be examined according to the rules of establishing [halacha] ... and because this resulted in a conclusion that contradicted the custom, the custom was pushed away by the halachic conclusion\".</p>\n<p>The Gra disagreed, treating the issue as any other <em>machlokes Rishonim</em> in which a definitive ruling already exists.</p>\n<p>He explains separately that R Tam's opinion was to put the parchments horizontally into the boxes and we don't follow his opinion. As such even R Tam was not wearing what we know today as R Tam's tefillin ! (Noda B'Yehuda explains why we don't follow this - R Tam was alone in his view while regarding the order of the parchments, other Rishonim concurred with him).</p>\n\n\n",

Another problem would be with giving someone punishment through a beis din (lashes, stoning, etc), and the defendant claims he was intoxicated when the witnesses warned him.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>According to <a href=\"http://dafnotes.blogspot.com/2006/07/daf-yomi-yoma-49-drunk-kohen.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Daf Yomi - Yoma 49 - Drunk Kohen</a> the shiur for <em>drunkenness</em> is only  a <em>reviis</em>. While this appears to be well below the level that would make him obviously drunk, it does prevent him from duchening or a rav from giving a psak.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>If he drinks wine more that a reviis (anywhere between 3.3 oz. and 4.6\n  approx), then he cannot duchan. This is if he drank this amount at one\n  shot and he didn't drink water with it.</p>\n  \n  <p>If he drinks other intoxicating liquids, then he can duchen as long as\n  he is not drunk.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>This is based on the Ramban as cited below.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The rationale of the Rambam is based on a Mishna in Bechoros that\n  states that one who is שיכור is not allowed to do the avodah because\n  it is considered a מום - a blemish and a blemish which is only\n  applicable to a person and not an animal does not invalidate the\n  korban. This explains why by ברכת כהנים, the Rambam only mentions wine\n  for that is learned from the passuk - יין ושכר אל תשת, however a כהן\n  who drinks other liquids and is rendered a בעל מום, he would still be\n  permitted to דוכן.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>As <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/a/86788/732\">SabbaHillel</a> said, that for Duchening, one would need to drink a Revi'is of wine.</p>\n\n<h2>For issuing rulings:</h2>\n\n<p>The Gemara in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Eruvin.64a?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Eiruvin 64a</a> says:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>אמר רב יהודה אמר שמואל שתה רביעית יין אל יורה\n  However, Rav Naḥman did not give his approval to all of Rav Yehuda’s rulings, as Rav Yehuda said that Shmuel said: If one drank a quarter-log of wine, he may not issue a halakhic ruling,However, Rav Naḥman did not give his approval to all of Rav Yehuda’s rulings, as Rav Yehuda said that Shmuel said: If one drank a quarter-log of wine, he may not issue a halakhic ruling,</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<h2>Praying:</h2>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>אמר רבה בר רב הונא שתוי אל יתפלל ואם התפלל תפלתו תפלה שיכור אל יתפלל ואם התפלל תפלתו תועבה</p>\n  \n  <p>On the topic of drinking wine, Rabba bar Rav Huna said: One who has drunk wine must not pray, but if he nonetheless prayed, his prayer is a prayer, i.e., he has fulfilled his obligation.

One who has drunk wine refers to anyone who has drunk wine but whose mind remains clear enough that he is able to talk in the presence of a king.

Dakkot, although not so common now, were the most common about one hundred years ago, when the process for making gassot tefillin was expensive and long. </p>\n\n<p>Many poskim today will tell you to go with gassot tefillin, because of their status of being made of one piece, not to mention their durability. </p>\n\n<p>In <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJD6cD0zG3E\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">this</a> video, you can see how gassot tefillin are made.

In verses 11-14 Nathan Hanovi warned Bas Sheva that there was danger to her son Sh'lomo and her if Adoniyahu remained the king. Adoniyahu was likely to try killing Shlomo, the rightful candidate for kingship, after David dies, similar to how Shaul sought to kill David - see also <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/I_Kings.1.21?lang=bi&with=Ralbag&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Ralbag on Melachim A 1:21</a>). The lack of invitation indicated the expected hostility towards both Sh'lomo and Bas Sheva.</p>\n<p>Mahari Kra comments on passuk 22: At this moment, Nathan haNovi walked in and Bas Sheva walked out due to respect. Therefore, Mahari Kra focusses on these later verses to explain the words of Nathan Hanovi which he repeats now after he said them to Bas Sheva in pesukim 11-14. Nathan speaks to David that <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/I_Kings.1.24-27?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Melachim A 1:24-27</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>24: Nathan said, “O lord king, you must have said, ‘Adonijah shall succeed me as king and he shall sit upon my throne.’ 25: For he has gone down today and prepared a sacrificial feast of a great many oxen, fatlings, and sheep. He invited all the king’s sons and the army officers and Abiathar the priest. At this very moment they are eating and drinking with him, and they are shouting, ‘Long live King Adonijah!’ 26: But he did not invite me your servant, or the priest Zadok, or Benaiah son of Jehoiada, or your servant Solomon. 27: Can this decision have come from my lord the king, without your telling your servant who is to succeed to the throne of my lord the king?”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Mahari Kra explains (in pesukim 25-26) the words of Nathan haNovi that seemingly Adoniyahu made himself a king, not by a pronouncement of a Kohen Gadol (Tzadok), not the Novi (Nathan), nor the Sanhedrin (Benayahu), as all 3 are required to appoint a king. And on possuk 27: and even if the king himself ordered to appoint (Adoniyahu) that was also not permitted because <strong>only a Novi could approve of the kingship</strong> as the Torah states <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Deuteronomy.17.15?vhe=Tanach_with_Ta%27amei_Hamikra&lang=bi&aliyot=0\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Devarim 17:15</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>You shall be free to set a king over yourself, <strong>one chosen by your G-d Hashem</strong>. Be sure to set as king over yourself one of your own people; you must not set a foreigner over you, one who is not your kin.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>That was how Sh'muel appointed Shaul and then David. Therefore, even if appointment of Adoniyahu was made by David himself, how could it be his kingship valid without informing your servant (Nathan haNovi to verify with G-d)?</p>\n\n\n",

    "title": "Was Avrohom really born in 1948?",
    "content": "# Was Avrohom really born in 1948?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>I have always been told that Avrohom Ovinu was born 1948 years after Odom was created. I recently thought I would add up the relevant figures in Sidra Bereisis and Sidra Noach to see what number I would end up with. I followed the logic that Odom begot Sheis at 130 (Gen. 5:3) and Sheis begot Enosh when he was 105 (5:6) making it 235, etc. For example, the posuk (5:32) says that Noach begot Sheim (Chom and Yefes) when he was 500 so I added 500 on to 1056 and got 1556.</p>\n\n<p>Somehow, I ended up with Avrohom being born at 1946 and not 1948. I redid this calculation several times and then on an excel spreadsheet and realized that there aren't any differences between the numbers I put in and the numbers the Toroh says.</p>\n\n<p>I looked up this query on google and found that on <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeline_of_Genesis_patriarchs\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">this Wikipedia page</a> it says that Avrohom was born in 1948 but that it should be 1946.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Why is there this discrepancy of figures and when was Avrohom actually born - 1948 or 1946?</strong></p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 12)\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>For example, the posuk (5:32) says that Noach begot Sheim (Chom and Yefes) when he was 500 so I added 500 on to 1056 and got 1556.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>But it doesn't say what order they were born in. Rashi later on (10:21) points out that Yefet is older since we know (11:10) Shem was 100 years old only 2 years after the flood, whereas we know (7:6) the flood started when Noach was 600. So Noach must have been 502 when Shem was born, which would make sense if Yefet was born first when Noach was 500. Probably those who calculate to 1948 are using this interpretation of when Shem was born.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>You are probably miscalculating the actual age of Noach at the time that Shem was born. Calculate using only the ages given in Noach starting from when Shem fathered Arpachshad. Then add the time to the date of the flood. The timeline in the Art Scroll Chumash (as one example) puts the date of the flood as 1656 AM.  I did the timeline myself based on the pesukim and did indeed show Noach was born in 1056 and the flood was in 1656 (as posted in <a href=\"https://sabbahillel.blogspot.com/2015/05/rabbi-leibtag-shiurim-hebrew-calendar.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rabbi Leibtag shiurim: The Hebrew Calendar and its Missing Years- Parts 1 - 3</a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.chabad.org/library/bible_cdo/aid/8175#v=10&showrashi=true\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Noach 11:10</a></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>These are the generations of Shem: Shem was one hundred years old, and\n  he begot Arpachshad, two years after the Flood.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>If you start from here and add the ages at the birth of each generation, you get (using the 70 years of Terach)</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.chabad.org/library/bible_cdo/aid/8175#v=26&showrashi=true\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Noach 11:26</a></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>And Terah lived seventy years, and he begot Abram, Nahor, and Haran.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>a total of 292 years after the flood. This now give 1656 + 292 = 1948.</p>\n\n<p>This assumes that Avraham was the eldest and was born when Terach was 70, unlike Shem who was the definitely born after Yafes (two years after Noach started having children at 500), as shown in the pasuk.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.chabad.org/library/bible_cdo/aid/8174#v=21&showrashi=true\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Noach 10:21</a></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>And to Shem were also born [children; he was] the father of all the\n  people of the other side [of the river], the brother of Japheth the\n  elder.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><strong>Rashi</strong></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><strong>the brother of Japheth, the elder</strong>: I do not know [from the wording of the verse] whether Japheth is the elder or Shem. [The verse may be\n  rendered: the elder brother of Japheth.] When Scripture says (11:10):\n  “Shem was a hundred years old, etc.” two years after the Flood, you\n  must say that Japheth was the elder, because Noah was five hundred\n  years old when he first had children, and the Flood came to pass in\n  the six hundredth year. Consequently, the eldest of his sons was a\n  hundred years old [at the time of the Flood], and Shem did not reach\n  [the age of] a hundred until two years after the Flood. — [from Gen.\n  Rabbah 37:7]</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Rashi says Cham was not the youngest, though Rav Hirsch translates <a href=\"http://www.chabad.org/library/bible_cdo/aid/8173/jewish/Chapter-9.htm#v=24&showrashi=true\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Noach 9:24</a> as <code>his youngest son</code>. However, this does not change the timeline based on 11:10.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>And Noah awoke from his wine, and he knew what his small son had done\n  to him.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Rav Hirsch translates this pasuk as:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>When Noach awoke from his wine and knew what his youngest son had done\n  unto him.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><strong>Rashi</strong></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><strong>his small son</strong>: The worthless and despicable one, like (Jer. 49:15): “Behold I have made you small among the nations; despised\n  among men.” - [from Gen.

There certainly must be some who consider him to be a Ploni, but is there anyone who tries to identify him, perhaps similar to יש''ו where some say it is an acronym and others say the acronym is also a name (Yeshu) and refers to you know who?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 13)\n\n<p>The <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=24723&st=&pgnum=207\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Sefer Yuchasin</a> mentions Plimo as someone in the times of Rebbe. This is echoed in the <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=46819&st=&pgnum=315\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Seder Hadoros</a>, and R.

Margoliot then develops a basis that Plimo is just the equivalent of Ploni (as asserted in the question). He notes that in Berachos 48a where Plimo is mentioned, there is an alternate version documented in the <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=38512&st=&pgnum=338\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Dikdukei Soferim</a> which says Palmoni (פלמוני). R. Margoliot suggests that Plimo is an abridged form of Palmoni and cites Daniel 8:13 where Palmoni is the equivalent of Ploni. According to this, then, Plimo is not actually a name; it is simply a designation for an unnamed figure. </p>\n\n<p>One potential issue with this is that the Dikdukei Soferim does not say פלמוני.

Avraham asked the three people he brought with him, Yishmael, Eliezer and Yitzchok, what they saw. He was hoping for a sign or indication as to which of the three he was to take with him. Yishmael and Eliezer only saw mountains. But Yitzchok saw the same prophetic vision that Avraham had seen, meaning the ring of clouds around Mount Moriah. That was how Avraham knew he was to take only Yitzchok with him from that point forward.</p>\n\n<p>In a similar vein, Avraham was shown in a prophetic vision the ram that was created on the sixth day of creation at sundown (Avot 5:6, Sefer HaYashar, שם ד״ה ויעקד אברהם את יצחק בנו). The horn of that ram is destined to become the shofar which Eliyahu HaNavi will blow at the time of the final redemption (Pirkei d’Rabbi Eliezer, chap. 31:76 toward the end, Midrash HaGadol to Vayera 22:13, Midrash Lekach Tov to Vayera 22:13).</p>\n\n<p>So in Lot's case, it would seem to be a connotation that he made an intellectual calculation, considering with his mind's eye, as to what would be the best deal for him.</p>\n\n\n",

He brings a number of grammatical parallels in the Mishnah and other writings which he sees as supportive. The author points out that the Teimanim have always pronounced it as such. He even references certain manuscripts of the Mishnah which include this pronunciation.</p>\n\n<p>As to the meaning of קִריַת שמע, the author presents a number of possibilities from various Teimani commentaries on the Mishneh Torah who - we should note - all took this girsa seriously:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>R. <a href=\"https://he.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D7%96%D7%9B%D7%A8%D7%99%D7%94_%D7%94%D7%A8%D7%95%D7%A4%D7%90\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Zeharya HaRofeh</a> (הרז\"ה), early 15th century, writes in his commentary to Mishneh Torah that קִריַת implies city-like:\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>כלומר, קריאה לפי סדר ידוע, כמו הבניין, מ[לשון] קריה נאמנה [ישעיה א, כא כו] וכו'.[15] ולכן קרא אותה קרית, ולא אמר קריאת\".</p>\n</blockquote></li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>R. <a href=\"http://www.hyomi.org.il/page.asp?id=386\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Chaim Korach</a> (b. 1823) offers a similar approach his commentary to Mishneh Torah, with additional explanation as to the connection of Shema to a city:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>ולמה נקרא שמה קרית שמע ולא אמר קריאת.[18] התשובה, שאין קריה פחותה מג' שכונות,[19] כמו שנאמר קריה נאמנה, ועוד.[20] לפי שיש בה ג' פרשיות, שמע והיה אם שמוע ויאמר\".</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<ol start=\"2\">\n<li><p>R. <a href=\"https://he.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D7%A1%D7%A2%D7%93%D7%99%D7%94_%D7%A2%D7%93%D7%A0%D7%99\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Saadyah Edni</a> (15th century), in his commentary to Mishneh Torah, explains (as translation by R. Pinchas Korach in his \"פירוש רבינו סעיד ן' דוד אלעדני\", קרית ספר ה'תש\"ע, עמ' כט) that, firstly, it's simply another way of writing the same thing. But then he adds that some say that it means to imply city-like structure of disparate components:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>ויש אומרים לפי שהיא צריכה קריאה בסדר ידוע כעין הבניה מן \"קריה נאמנה\" (ישעיה א, כא), ולכן אמר קרית שמע. ויש אומרים לפי שהיא מיוסדת ממקומות רבים, לפי שהיא שלש פרשיות משלשה מקומות מן התורה\".</p>\n</blockquote></li>\n<li><p>R. <a href=\"https://he.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D7%99%D7%A6%D7%97%D7%A7_%D7%95%D7%A0%D7%94\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Yitzchak Wanna</a>, in the late 16 - early 17th century, wrote along the same lines in one of his works:</p></li>\n</ol>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>קרית שמע, כמו קריאת. ולשון קריה היא. תרגום ערים, קרוין. כלומר שאינה במקום אחד בתורה, אלא במקומות הרבה כמו הערים שאחת הנה ואחת הנה\".</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>In conclusion, at least amongst many of the Teimani scholars of Rambam's writings, his spelling of קרית שמע was seen as intentional, with both grammatical validity and a lesson to be learned.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Is there a differencce between הֲמִיתוֹ and לַהֲמִיתוֹ?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>In Sh'mot, 4:24, the text reads, \"וַיְהִ֥י בַדֶּ֖רֶךְ בַּמָּל֑וֹן וַיִּפְגְּשֵׁ֣הוּ יְהוָ֔ה וַיְבַקֵּ֖שׁ הֲמִיתֽוֹ׃ \" and the English there (from the sefaria.org page, but the Stone chumash concurs) for the final 2 words is \"and sought to kill him.\" Yirmiyahu 26:21 has a similar construction, for which the sefaria.org has \"<strong>to put him to death</strong>.\" The only other instance of הֲמִיתֽוֹ is in Mishlei 19:18 which reads \" וְאֶל־הֲ֝מִית֗וֹ \" and is translated as \"on his destruction\" (removing any active participation in the killing).</p>\n\n<p>But Tehillim 37:32 has the phrase \"וּמְבַקֵּשׁ <strong>לַ</strong> הֲמִיתוֹ\" (\"seeking <strong>to put him to death</strong>\") and the word with the lamed occurs 5 other times, always meaning \"to kill/put to death.\"</p>\n\n<p>It seems to me that for the word to be translated as an infinitive verb, \"to kill\", would require the lamed and that appears 6 times. And yet in two cases, the form without the lamed is still translated as that infinitive form.</p>\n\n<p>Are there any commentaries that explore the difference between the form with and without the lamed or which explain how the form without the lamed can still be understood as the active infinitive verb (as opposed to the more passive sense)?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>Forgive my English, but in Hebrew the original definitive form of a verb (contrary to the Modern Hebrew) is without ל, like דבר instead of לדבר etc. Four letters - בכל\"מ can further constitute a pseudo-definitive form, like לדבר, בדבר, מדבר, כדבר. As you can understand the have slightly different meaning, and it is comparable to its English translations: ל meaning \"to\", מ meaning \"from\", כ being \"like\" and ב meaning \"like\".</p>\n\n<p>Compare: \"בְּי֗וֹם עֲשׂ֛וֹת ה\"א אֶ֥רֶץ וְשָׁמָֽיִם\" (Ber 2, 4) like \"ביום לעשות\".

For example, instant coffee can be made because the coffee has already been cooked; are there any other common foods or drinks that can similarly be prepared because they've already been cooked?</p>\n\n<p>(I'm particularly interested because of the usefulness when travelling but interested more generally as well.)</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>I think you can start getting some ideas by reading this <a href=\"http://rabbikaganoff.com/bedeviled-by-stirring-events-%E2%80%93-or-some-insights-on-the-melacha-of-losh/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rabbi Kaganoff</a> article. It won't answer every type of instant food around, but it should give you some ideas of the main rules. Before starting, we have to assume that the base ingredient has already been cooked, so instant coffee, would be OK. I'm unfamiliar with how powdered milk is made. Of course, if you add cold water to any instant item, there is no concern of cooking it, anyway.</p>\n\n<p>The bigger problem that Kaganoff's article addresses is the melacha of <em>losh</em> or kneading (forming a \"dough\"). Generally, in the article, he claims that if the \"instant\" items are small and adding liquid forms a sticky dough-like mass, then you have a problem. A similar problem happens if you form a \"batter\".</p>\n\n<p>Applying these rules, from my best analysis, using milk powder doesn't seem to be a problem because it doesn't form a dough. Same thing to be said with soup powder. But instant mashed potatoes would probably be a problem. Now that I think about it, tahini has a strange character. It first becomes a \"dough\", but as you add more water, it thins out. So, I'll try to re-ask my rav why he believes this is still OK, but why mashed potatoes may be a problem. To me, they both seem to act similarly.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# 3 major sins versus suicide\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>According to the rambam that unlike all other prohibitory mitzvos there are 3 that one must give up one's life for rather than be forced to commit. Does the requirement to give up one's life rather than commit then include suicide if one's has a compulsion to do these three things?   </p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>While as far as I know he never addresses this explicitly [i], In all of Rambam's discussion of cardinal sins, he always writes that one allows oneself to be killed (Sefer Hamitsvot Lo Taaseh 63, Hilkhot Yesodei HaTorah 5:2, and Iggeret HaShmad); never that one actively kills himself. </p>\n\n<p>Indeed, suicide is completely forbidden according to Rambam, and he never states any exception to this. For example, in Hilkhot Rotseah (2:2-3) he includes one who commits suicide on a list of those who are considered murderers who are liable to death at the hands of heaven.</p>\n\n<p>In fact, even in a case where someone is coercing a Jew to commit one of the non-cardinal sins, if one allows himself to be killed, rather than committing the sin, although this \"suicide\" is not his direct action, but that of his oppressors, and although it is being done for a noble purpose, Rambam nevertheless writes (Yesodei HaTorah 5:1) that this is a great sin: הרי זה מתחייב בנפשו.</p>\n\n<p>So, if by all indications, even where someone else is coercing you to sin, there is no permission for suicide, a fortiori, when the oppressor coercing one to sin is oneself, there would be no permission to escape through suicide. This would just be murder, and quite possibly be considered a cardinal sin in and of itself.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>[i] Given the above, the lack of explicit mention is understandable. Given that it would be an exception to the existing rules he mentions, if he didn't hold of it, there would be no reason to mention it.</p>\n\n\n",

Does not make a definitive statement about the existence of G-d or the Torah’s divine source classified halachically as a min (a heretic)?</p>\n\n<p>The presumption of this question is that we find in Rashi (beginning of the 10 perek in Sanhedrin 90a) about who denies the belief of תחיית המתים מן התורה, that there is no proof from within the torah about the rising of the dead in the Messianic times is considered a Kofer. Rashi explains, even if one were to belief in the concept but deny that it has a source in the torah is also considered a heretic. The suggestion being that the torah requires a clear and definitive proof that stems from the torah, and not just a logically based belief.</p>\n\n<p>This Gemara and rashi’s explanation connects to agnosticism in the sense that it, per the definitions above, is inherently an doubtful stance. But we see clearly that one cannot even logically deduce such a belief, all the more so if one is not even sure.</p>\n\n<p>Thus, is agnosticism included in the category of heresy?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>Having doubts is not only normal, it is proper and good. Even the מלאכים ask \"where is the place of his glory.\"  Yirmiyah lambastes the priests of his times for not asking \"where is Hashem\" (<em>see</em> Jer. 2:10). Prophets prophesied about the destruction of those who did not seek Hashem and search him out (<em>see, e.g.</em>, Zeph. 1:6). You don't seek or search out something you already have. <strong>The first step to knowledge of Hashem is acknowledgment of doubt.</strong></p>\n\n<p>The foolishness of the fool is in the egotistical complacency of accepting doubt as an end in itself. His foolishness is egotistical because it is his great adoration of himself that blinds him from the understanding of the obvious, that his doubts are just questions he has merited to realize, they are not answers. He imagines that his great questions which put him above the common unquestioning crowd are a good stopping point, because all he is really thinking about is being above the common.</p>\n\n<p>If an agnostic is someone who believes there is no true knowledge, who believes that doubt is itself truth, then an agnostic is a fool. He also contradicts the words of the Torah and the prophets. \"And you shall <strong>know</strong> today\" (Deut. 4:39). \"Have you not known? Have you not heard? The God of the world is Hashem, creator of the ends of the earth.\" (Isa. 40:28).</p>\n\n<p>On the other hand, if the agnostic is someone who does not assert the falsehood of truth, but simply acknowledges his lack of knowledge, doubts his own self-made assumptions, and hopes and prays for truth and understanding, about such a person Yeshaya says \"But those who hope for Hashem will renew their strength, will mount up with wings like eagles, will run and not be weary, will walk and not be faint.\" (Isa. 40:31).</p>\n\n\n",

Ashkenazim have the custom of not naming a child after any living person. One of the reasons is that there is a halachic problem with a father and son having the same name.</p>\n\n<p>I answer at <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/79100/naming-children-after-living-people/79104#79104\">Naming Children After Living People</a> that this is based on the halachic difficulty in <em>kabeid es Avicha</em> when the father and son have the same name. Note that it is not a halacha not to share the name, but a minhag derived from the halachic problems that could arise. From  the name given as an example, it seems that the OP is asking from the Ashkenaz viewpoint. IIRC even Sefardim who do name after a (living) grandfather, do not name children after a (living) father. I will look this up to check for confirmation of my memory.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>According to Jewish law it is not deemed proper respect to call one’s\n  parent by his/her first name.(Yoreh Deah 240:2) Giving a child the\n  name of the living parent or grandparent would generate confusion and\n  a belittlement of respect.(Chelkat Yaakov, Yoreh Deah 136,Shmirat\n  HaGuf V’haNefesh, Vol. II, 154:9) </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p><strong>UPDATE</strong></p>\n\n<p>Originally I only found implicit references to sefardim not naming a child after a (living) father, while they do name after a (living) grandfather.</p>\n\n<p>As an example, <a href=\"https://www.jewishgen.org/Sephardic/differ.HTM\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Naming Conventions</a> lists the common Sefardi custom of naming as </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Common Sephardic naming conventions (also see Jewish Names):</p>\n\n<pre><code>Firstborn son named after the paternal grandfather,  \nsecond male child after the maternal grandfather,  \nfirst daughter named after the paternal grandmother,  \nsecond female child after the maternal grandmother,  \nnext child after the paternal uncle or aunt,  \nnext after maternal uncle/aunt,  \netc.\n</code></pre>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Note that the parents are never included in this list as each additional child gets named after a more remote relative.

Yehuda Assad (1796-1866) in Yehuda Ya’aleh, Yoreh Deah 247, states that there is a comment by Rashi on Divrei HaYamim I 2:50 that Chur named his son after his own father Kalev who was still alive at the time. In <em>Jerusalem Talmud, Yoma 6:3</em>, we find that Shimon HaTzadik foresaw his own death and instructed his son Nechunya to take his place, thereby sparking the jealousy of his other son Shimon. as well as some other cases. \nRabbi Zilberstein also references the <em>Sefer Chassidim 460</em> speaks about the Ashkenaz custom while Chida, noted in Brit Olam that, <strong><code>although some customs allow naming children after living grandparents, all customs agree not to name after oneself</code></strong>.  Additionally, R. Assad is found to have addressed the situation of a father named Yitzchak Ber who named his son Ber.  <code>Although it was once accepted to name a child after a living parent, it was no longer the custom, and one must not go against the current prevailing custom</code>.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>In his <a href=\"https://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=21838&st=&pgnum=160\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">diary entry</a> for June 7th, 1778 <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chaim_Yosef_David_Azulai\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">R.

    "content": "# Should one relight the Havdalah candle that went out in the middle of Havdalah?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p><strong>Background information:</strong></p>\n\n<p>The Havdalah prayer is comprised of 4 blessings: Wine, Spices, Fire, and Havdalah. However, the middle two blessings are not really part of Havdalah itself, but rather, since the Chachamim wanted people to say those blessings on Motzai Shabbos, they tied it to Havdalah so it could be said over a cup of wine. </p>\n\n<p>However, those are technically self-standing blessings, and while one should try to have all the pieces at once and even postpone Havdalah until later in the night if that's when he'll have all the items needed, one can say Havdalah without a candle, and one could say the blessing on the candle without Havdalah (see Shmiras Shabbos Kehilchasah Vol. 2, 61:17-18).</p>\n\n<p>Note that while this question also would apply to the blessing on spices as well, I'm mainly focusing on the blessing of fire for two reasons: First, if there is some sort of Hefsek issue, it's more likely to occur with the fire, as that generally would be a more involved process to relight. I don't think a smaller Hefsek (i.e. opening the spice jar) would be something that anyone would be Choshesh for, but granted, if you can think of a longer scenario involving the spices, the same question could be asked there. Second, Ma'aseh Shehaya Kach Hava (but of course, for any specific example, CYLOR) ;)</p>\n\n<p><strong>Here's the question:</strong></p>\n\n<p>You're saying Havdalah, and in the middle of the first two blessings, the Havdalah Candle goes out.</p>\n\n<p>Should you relight the Havdalah candle before saying the blessing on the candle, or should you finish the rest of Havdalah, then say the blessing on the candle later separately?</p>\n\n<p>Would you say that once you've started Havdalah, it would be a Hefsek to relight the candle before saying the last blessing (therefore skip that Brachah for now and say it some time later on its' own)? Or would it not be considered a Hefsek to relight the candle?</p>\n\n<p>If you are supposed to relight the candle, does it matter how long it takes to relight it (i.e. the matches were already put away and you'd need to get a new box)?</p>\n\n\n",

It is within this context that I asked the below question yesterday (which was flagged as off-topic):</p>\n\n<p>I have a question about the Sephardic pronunciation of the tsere vowel.</p>\n\n<p>I learned that it is pronounced as \"ei\" or \"ay\" as in the English \"hay\", however, I think I may have also read somewhere that it is also sometimes pronounced as the \"e\" in \"bed\", in which case it would have the same sound as a segol.</p>\n\n<p>Now I am learning the names of the hebrew letters, and according to the book I have, several of the names are spelled in hebrew using a tsere.</p>\n\n<p>For instance ב is written בֵּית and ה is written as הֵא. At the same time in English my book writes that ב is \"Bet\" and  ה is \"He\"; and in a different book ה is \"Hey\". (I have the same question for ח, ט,  מ, פ, and ר as they all use a tsere in hebrew).</p>\n\n<p>So my question is, which sound is the correct pronunciation for ב ,ה, and the other letters mentioned? For ב is the \"e\" in Bet pronounced \"ay\" as in hay (which would sound the same as \"bait\"), or \"e\" as in \"bed\"? </p>\n\n<p>It is very confusing because, for instance, ג is written in English as Gimel, but the \"e\" here has to be like the \"e\" as in \"bed\" because it is written in hebrew with a seghol (גִּמֶּל).</p>\n\n<p>Thanks for your help.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>The original pronunciation (see שפת אמת שפתי כהן by R' Bentzion Cohen) is an elongated “e”, as in the word air (British pronunciation).</p>\n<p>However, following one's tradition is completely acceptable; so an Ashkenazi may continue to pronounce it as “ey” if they wish.</p>\n\n\n",

We read about his birth and <em>akeida</em> in Vayeira, he gets married to Rivkah in Chayei Sarah (very little mentioning of him, in this parsha). Toldot seems to be the main parsha were we seem most of his activity, then, near the end of the parsha, we see he is about to die. There's very little mentioned about him in comparsion to his father and his son.</p>\n\n<p>Why does the Torah spend little time talking about him? Was there so little that occurred to him by comparison? </p>\n\n<p>Feel free to improve the tagging. Offhand, I didn't think of including all the various parshiot, as I'm not really asking about something specific to any parsha.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>R' Yaakov Kaminetzky points this out in his first entry on Parshas Toldos. He also points out that in the Rambam's brief historical description of the impact of the Avos (Hil. Avodas Kochavim 1:3) Yitzchok gets pretty short shrift, with a one-line mention about how he taught his son Yaakov.</p>\n\n<p>It's worth seeing inside, but R' Yaakov's basic approach is that each of the Avos had their approach to relating to Hashem, which is what they really conveyed to others. Avraham conveyed to others that Hashem was the Source and Essence of חסד. Yaakov established the search for truth and the G-d of truth.</p>\n\n<p>Yitzchak's approach, however, was the approach of justice and judgement, and preached a life of self-discipline and exactitude in lining up with what Hashem wants from a person, with no room for compromise. This approach was not as popular, as one might imagine, by the general masses, and therefore Yitzchak was not as involved in the world as the other Avos, and his only disciple was his son Yaakov.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>The Avos all had different purposes & missions based on their unique personalities. Avraham Avinu first discovered the true path & being the epitome of Chesed used his social skills to teach his Torah to every soul he interacted with. Yitzchak on the other hand was a man of great Gevurah & as we see with his compliance with the Akeida was the greatest & most loyal Talmid. He spent much of his time meditating in the field absorbing his fathers teachings & using his inner strength to completely internalize it. Yaakov perfected the Chesed - Gevurah approach into Tiferes which is why his life’s work was turning this “father & son shop” into a global phenomenon through the Shevatim. While Avraham & Yaakov’s approaches afforded them many opportunities to interact with the outside world & the more amazing great Tzadikim interact with the outside world the more amazing great stories & lessons can be gleaned from their life, hence their “longer screen time”. Yitzchak worked mainly introspectively on perfecting his Fathers complex Torah & paving the path for Yaakov to teach a more comprehensive & complete ideology to his 12 sons & ultimately to us all. Since the purpose of Berashis is, in large part, maaseh avos siman l'banim the torah focuses on the stories which teach us the most. We can speculate that more can be learned from the interpersonal interactions than quiet introspection. </p>\n\n\n",

It is the only strictly religious command in the Ten\n  Commandments: its fulfilment is insisted upon by the otherwise\n  antiritualistic prophets; it was a most strictly observed commandment\n  throughout 2,000 years of Diaspora life, wherein its observation often\n  was hard and difficult. It can hardly be doubted that the Shabbat was\n  the fountain of life for the Jews, who, scattered, powerless, and\n  often despised and persecuted, renewed their pride and dignity when\n  like kings they celebrated the Shabbat. Is the Shabbat nothing but a\n  day of rest in the mundane sense of freeing people, at least on one\n  day, from the burden of work? To be sure it is that, and this function\n  gives it the dignity of one of the great innovations in human\n  evolution.</p>\n  \n  <p>Yet if this were all that it was, the Shabbat would hardly have played\n  the central role I have just described. In order to understand this\n  role we must penetrate to the core of the Shabbat institution. It is\n  not rest per se, in the sense of not making an effort, physically or\n  mentally. It is rest in the sense of the re-establishment of complete\n  harmony between human beings and between them and nature. Nothing must\n  be destroyed and nothing be built: the Shabbat is a day of truce in\n  the human battle with the world. Even tearing up a blade of grass is\n  looked upon as a breach of this harmony, as is lighting a match… On\n  the Shabbat one lives as if one has nothing, pursuing no aim except\n  being, that is, expressing one’s essential powers: praying, studying,\n  eating, drinking, singing, making love. The Shabbat is a day of joy\n  because on that day one is fully oneself.</p>\n  \n  <p>This is the reason the Talmud calls a Shabbat the anticipation of the\n  Messianic Time, and the Messianic Time the unending Shabbat : the day\n  on which property and money as well as mourning and sadness are tabu;\n  a day on which time is defeated and pure being rules. The historical\n  predecessor, the Babylonian Shapatu, was a day of sadness and fear.\n  The modern Sunday is a day of fun, consumption, and running away from\n  oneself. One might ask if it is not time to re-establish the Shabbat\n  as  a universal day of harmony and peace, as the human day that\n  anticipates the human future.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>There's certainly nothing in that quotation that traditional attitudes towards Shabbat would find objectionable. It's perfectly fine that each generation will have a slightly different angle on the philosophical approach to the day; former Senator Joseph Lieberman recently wrote a book on what it meant to him.</p>\n\n<p>We keep it because God commanded; and the quote above about <em>how</em> it's physically observed basically got right that \"keep the Shabbat\" traditionally included things like not uprooting a single blade of grass. At that point, if Fromm's way of thinking about it works for you, that's great.</p>\n\n<p>I will point out in support of Fromm that Hebrew has no word for \"have\", only \"to be.\" <em>I have a car</em> in Hebrew is <em>yesh li mechonit</em> -- \"there exists to me a car.\" <em>She had a car</em> would translate literally as \"it was to her a car.\"</p>\n\n\n",

Fatima was the wife of Ali and Aisha was the wife of Mohammed. This parallel to Yishmael is striking.</li>\n<li>Numbers (24:19) mentions Constantinople. This seems anachronistic for an allegedly Tannaic Targum.</li>\n<li>Leviticus (7:27) could be interpreted as forbidding the consumption of the blood of fish. </li>\n<li>Numbers (5:17) suggests a vessel is necessary to take water from the kiyyor. This is not found in halakha.</li>\n<li>Leviticus (18:21) presents a biblical prohibition against impregnating a non-Jewish woman, instead of for molekh; an interpretation condemned by the Mishna Megilla (4:9). Notably, this interpretation was popular among Karaites.[i]</li>\n<li>Leviticus (1:4) and (3:2) indicates that semikha must be done with the right hand in particular. Notably, this too was a Karaite position.[i]</li>\n<li>Deuteronomy (34:5) indicates that the exemption for a newlywed groom from going to battle, only applies to marriage to a virgin. This was also the position of many Karaites.[i]</li>\n<li>Leviticus (19:20) indicates that the shifha harufa is betrothed to a free man. According to halakha, the betrothal is to a slave (Sifra Kedoshim 5:2).</li>\n<li>Exodus (22:2) indicates slaves are freed at shemitta; not after seven years.</li>\n<li>Deuteronomy (22:5) indicates that shaving the face is lo tilbash. This is not mentioned in classical halakhic sources (yes I know the Tsemah Tsedek).</li>\n<li>Leviticus (13:45) has a herald shouting tamei tamei, rather than himself. This halakha is not found elsewhere.</li>\n<li>Exodus (12:46) introduces a prohibition of giving gifts on Pesah.</li>\n<li>Leviticus (11:11) bans benefit from non-kosher fish.[ii]</li>\n<li>Deuteronomy (22:26) could be read as requiring a get from the rapist of a naara m'urasa. This is against halakha as she couldn't become mekudeshet to him anyway (and there is no reason to assume that she did even if she could).[iii]</li>\n<li>Numbers (18:13) indicates that bikkurim is brought from all fruit trees; not just the seven species, but apparently not wheat or barley which are included in the seven.</li>\n<li>Leviticus (22:28) emphasises that the reason for the prohibition of slaughtering a cow and its calf on the same day is mercy. This is against the Yerushalmi Berakhot (5:3) that opposes such a Targum:</li>\n</ul>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>לא עבדין טבות שעושין למדותיו של הקב\"ה רחמים ואילין דמתרגמין <strong>עמי בני ישראל כמה דאנא רחמן בשמים כך תהוון רחמנין בארעא תורתא או רחילה יתה וית ברה לא תיכסון תרויהון ביומא חד</strong> לא עבדין טבאות שהן עושין מדותיו של הקב\"ה רחמים</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Compare that to the wording of the Targum:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>עַמִי בְּנֵי יִשְׂרָאֵל הֵיכְמָא דְאָבוּנָן רַחֲמָן בִּשְׁמַיָא כֵּן תֶּהֱוֹן רַחֲמָנִין בְּאַרְעָא תּוֹרָתָא אוֹ רְחֵילָא יָתָהּ וְיַת בְּרָהּ לָא תִיכְסוּן בְּיוֹמָא חָד </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Presenting the very banned Targum certainly raises eyebrows.[iv] </p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>[i] See The <a href=\"https://books.google.com/books?id=lI1JAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA533&lpg=PA533&dq=Targum%20pseudo%20Jonathan%20karaite%20geiger&source=bl&ots=Ar9-EW8EeS&sig=n_ZJeVFHb_qd4_MmzFkfH1tweHE&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjbw8bTiMLXAhXF7YMKHclnBK8Q6AEIKDAA#v=onepage&q=Targum%20pseudo%20Jonathan%20karaite%20geiger&f=false\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Jewish Quarterly Review, Volume 2 pp. 536-7</a>.

This would be related to the view of Avuha Dishmuel in Ketubot (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Ketubot.51b.8?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"noreferrer\">51b</a>) that a raped woman is forbidden to her husband since she might have acquiesced. It is certainly not the halakha though, and Avuha Dishmuel himself did not defend his position against seeming refutation.</p>\n\n<p>[iv] Seeing other commentators (e.g. Moreh Nevokhim 3:48) suggest that the reason is divine mercy might also raise eyebrows, but that doesn't resolve the issue with the Targum; it just leaves two issues. In reality, the problem with the Targum is greater since some things may be appropriate to say, but not in the context of a Targum. For example, Megilla (4:10) states that some verses are not to be translated (by the meturgeman) at all. The Mishna clearly didn't ban the study or discussion of these verses, but their presentation in a Targum format. Similarly, a ban on a certain Targum may be limited to a Targum format, rather than simply explicating the idea.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>Culled from <a href=\"http://discovery.ucl.ac.uk/1318065/1/322506.pdf\" rel=\"noreferrer\">this dissertation</a>.</p>\n\n\n",

(Soncino translation)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>In other words, the Talmud derives from the fact that the primary example of ritual writing is juxtaposed (in the verses in Shema) to the commandment of Tefillin, which only Jewish adult free men are obligated in, that ritual writing for a Torah scroll, Tefillin and Mezuzot (the Mitzva objects which can be created by a specific writing process) must be performed by Jewish adult free men.</p>\n<p>(As noted in the answer there, she <em>can</em> write books of Tanakh, just writing the five books of the Torah wouldn't create a \"Torah scroll\" but rather something more like a Chumash, just like her writing the text of a Mezuzah wouldn't create a Mezuzah but rather just an object that could be used to read Shema from or something. The exclusion above is from the ability to create those three Mitzva objects, not from writing itself.)</p>\n\n\n",

I know far more people who are still awake at that time (generally somewhere between 12 AM & 1 AM) than who sleep before it and wake up for it.  So why do texts that discuss saying tikkun chatzot talk about waking up for it, rather than staying awake until chatzot, reciting tikkun and then going to bed until shacharit?</p>\n<p>EDIT:  Shulchan Aruch Orach Chaim 1:2:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>ב הַמַּשְׁכִּים לְהִתְחַנֵּן לִפְנֵי בּוֹרְאוֹ, יְכַוֵּן לַשָּׁעוֹת שֶׁמִּשְׁתַּנּוֹת הַמִּשְׁמָרוֹת שֶׁהֵן בִּשְׁלִישׁ הַלַּיְלָה וּלְסוֹף שְׁנֵי שְׁלִישֵׁי הַלַּיְלָה וּלְסוֹף הַלַּיְלָה, שֶׁהַתְּפִלָּה שֶׁיִּתְפַּלֵּל בְּאוֹתָן הַשָּׁעוֹת עַל הַחֻרְבָּן וְעַל הַגָּלוּת, רְצוּיָה. ‏</p>\n<p>One who rises to pray before his Creator should aim for the watches of seasonal hours, which are at 1/3 through the night, 2/3 through the night and the end of the night, because the prayer one prays at those times over destruction and exile are more accepted.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>Historically, people did not stay awake long after dark. At night, you went to sleep; in the morning, you woke up. So when would you say tikkun chatzot? During the hour or two between your first and second sleeps. Most people don't know that sleeping for 8 hours straight is unnatural. It was far more common to sleep for 4 hours, wake up for an hour or two, then sleep for another 4 hours. A quick Google search for \"first sleep second sleep\" brings up articles from <a href=\"http://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-16964783\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">BBC</a> and <a href=\"https://www.sciencealert.com/humans-used-to-sleep-in-two-shifts-and-maybe-we-should-start-to-again\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Science Alert</a>, among others. When light at night became too common, people changed their sleeping patterns and stay awake longer into the night.</p>\n\n<p>So, of course the texts discuss waking up for it. It's the natural thing to do.</p>\n\n<p>As an aside, when i first learned this it gave me a new understanding to חצות לילה אקום להודות לך (<a href=\"http://www.sefaria.org/Psalms.119.62\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Tehillim 119:62</a>).</p>\n\n\n",

We wear a tallit because we want the mitzva of tzitzit. Therefore we look for a garment which is obligated in the mitzva, i.e., has four corners (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Mishneh_Torah,_Fringes.3.1?lang=bi\" rel=\"noreferrer\">MT Hilchot Tzitzit 3:1</a>)</p>\n\n<p>The reason we want the mitzva of tzitzit is that it is an important mitzva. In the words of the Rambam (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Mishneh_Torah,_Fringes.3.12?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Hilchot Tzitzit 3:12</a>)</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>since the Torah estimates it as so weighty that all the commandments\n  are made dependent upon it, as it is said, \"And ye shall look upon it\n  and remember all the commandments of the Lord\" (Numbers 15:39)</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Our ancestors wore garments that had four corners anyway (think of poncho-like garments or capes), therefore didn’t have the need for a tallit <a href=\"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tallit#History\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Wikipedia</a> explains</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Though in biblical times the tzitzit were attached to such everyday\n  garments, both the present tallit gadol and tallit katan developed\n  subsequently to address the fact that Jews no longer wore\n  four-cornered garments, and were in danger therefore of losing this\n  mitzvah. [...]</p>\n  \n  <p>In the book The Ancient Jewish Shroud At Turin by John N. Lupia [he]\n  shows the historical development of the tallit when its design began\n  to change during the second half of the first century CE and began to\n  take on the forms known today beginning around 1000 CE. The long\n  tradition of a single orthodox form of the tallit became modified in a\n  more culturally diverse atmosphere and continued to change throughout\n  time until it became permuted and shortened in length as the kitel,\n  tallit katan, tallit gadol, and the more common tallit prayer shawl\n  form know today.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

However, if one of them is eating non-kosher meat (or milk), the other can eat milk (or meat), since there's no worry that the latter will eat the former's food, as he's repelled by non-kosher food. Why aren't we concerned the former will eat the latter's food? It should be disallowed for kosher-observer to eat with the other lest he share food with him and cause him to eat milk and meat: surely there's no repulsion there.

That would seem to imply that he does apply the Issur of eating on the same table to things that are always forbidden for you to eat! </p>\n\n<p>However, the truth is that he only forbids considers there to be a possible issue with eating on the same table as something that you made a vow against because that is also not something he is used to separating from. </p>\n\n<p>The Rashba and Shulchan Aruch (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Shulchan_Arukh%2C_Orach_Chayim.440.3?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">O.C. 440:3</a>) forbid eating on the same table as a Goy's Chametz, because of the Chumrah of Chametz. Since its Assur Bimashehu (even a tiny bit is forbidden) we are concerned that a drop may land in the Jews food, which is why it's Assur even on a separate tablecloth (which would normally be okay if one person was eating meat and the other was eating milk). </p>\n\n<p>However, based on the Orchos Chaim it sounds like the issue is specifically by bread, because bread is man's primary sustenance, and he's used to eating it all year, which is similar to the way the Rosh forbade eating on the same table without a Hekker by Pas Akkum.</p>\n\n<p>Note that the Shach there only permits eating Kosher meat at the same time as Treif meat. Additionally, as has been pointed out by the commentators above the person is already eating Treif. We don't make Gezeiros that he may come to cook it with milk which may or may not be Assur depending whether you hold of the Nekuda Nifla'ah.\nThis is especially true according to the Pleisi 88:1 </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>שלא יבאו לאוכלם יחד. וכן הוא לשון הרמב\"ם (פ\"ט ה\"כ). ואע\"ג דבגמרא (ק\"ד ע\"ב) נאמר שמא יעלה באלפס רותח כלי ראשון. יש לומר דרמב\"ם ס\"ל דכל זה לרב יוסף דדייק [ד]בשר [עוף] בחלב דאורייתא דאם לא כן הא הוי גזרה לגזרה, דאינו אסור מתורה רק דרך בישול, ולכך הוצרך לומר דיעלה באלפס וכו'. אבל לפי דקיימ\"ל כאביי (שם) דבשר [בחלב] בעוף מדרבנן, ומ\"מ גזרינן גזירה לגזרה, א\"כ אין צריך לומר דחששו לאלפס, רק פשוט דיאכלנו יחד, ואי דהוי דרבנן, מה בכך, אף לאיסור דרבנן חששו, וגזרו הרחקה טפי. ואתי שפיר.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>who says that Halacha Lemaisa we are only concerned that they will eat it together, not that they will cook it together.</p>\n\n<p>Finally, see later on in that Pleisi where he writes that there is no problem with eating on the same table as someone from a different religion since the distance between people of two different religions is greater than the distance between people who dislike each other and therefore you wouldn't need to be concerned that you'll come to eat from each other's food.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>ובאמת לא הבנתי מי שם אחוה וריעות בין יהודי לעכו\"ם, הלא הלבבות רחוקות, ואין פירוד לבבות כפירוד הדתות, ואפילו שימת חן אסרוהו, וא\"כ הוי ליה כאכסניא וכבני אדם שאינם מכירין זה את זה, והיש יותר איבה מבין שני בעלי דתות, נראים כאוהבין בשעת הנאתן וכו'. ולכן דברי הר\"ן לא הבנתי, ולכן בתרומת יין בא\"י וכדומה [יש] להחמיר.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>See also Teshuvos Beis Yaakov 12 (quoted in Darkei teshuva 88:15, Ayen Sham) and Vedarashta Vichakarta Chelek Gimmel Y.D.

He is not a Mored (which would incur a forced divorce straight away and payment of kesuba if husband is mored by making a Neder she cannot live with) and She is not a moredes (which would incur a forced divorce straight away without the payment of the kesuba). So we wait 6 months which is the maximum wait for relations for a woman (e.g if her husband is a sailor) and he should then divorce her with a Kesuba unless she wants to remain married despite being forbidden to her husband as prescribed in Shulchan Aruch Even Haezer 77.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>So we see that if she transgresses her husband's stipulation even against her own benefit (e.g., not put make up on), that triggers her husbands neder to forbid her relations. This is in spite of the husband making a positve stipulation that he may think is for her own good.<br>\nStipulating to not let her see her parents for a week while it might not affect her for just 1 week (which is why the husband is not a Mored), is a negative stipulation that encroaches on her freedom. If she can transgress a positive stipulation, how much more so should she be allowed to transgress a negative stipulation to go and see them if she wants to, thus forbiding relations with her husband, remaining married for the next 6 months leading to divorce with kesuba and she is not a Moredes.</p>\n\n<p>Conclusion: A husband that Dominates his wife's normal freedom that the Torah allows, by making stipulations leading to nedarim to disallow her to do something, cannot force the wife to comply.<br>\nIf she does not keep the stipulation even though the Husband's neder now works that she can no longer have relations with him  (if she has relations she transgresses lo yachel devaro), her choice  to not keep the tenai (stipulation), enables her to receive a forced divorce after 6 months no relations, and she gets her full kesuba.</p>\n\n\n",

The Shulchan Aruch (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Shulchan_Arukh,_Orach_Chayim.426.3\" rel=\"noreferrer\">OC 426:3</a>) says one can say Kiddush Levana until but not including 16 days from the Molad (the new moon, the start of the lunar cycle). The Rema says it can be said until the halfway point of the lunar cycle mentioned above, since at that point the moon is full and begins to wane (on a side point the Aruch Hashulchan <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Aruch_HaShulchan.1.426.11\" rel=\"noreferrer\">says</a> the SA agrees he just didn't bother writing precisely).

The continuation of that teshuva mentions that if a Lunar Eclipse occurs before this cut off time, then one can no longer say Kiddush Levana. This is because a Lunar Eclipse only occurs when the moon is full. One therefore cannot say Kiddush Levana even if the halfway point of the above cycle hasn't occured.

The Rema doesn't mention it, nor the Mishnah Berurah or Aruch Hashulchan. Is there anyone who rules in accordance with this teshuva?

But, the Midrash (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Bereishit_Rabbah.15.6?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Bereishis Rabbah 15:6</a>) mentions a teaching from Rabbi Yehudah Bar Ela'ayi which says that the tree was pretty big, extending for the journey of five hundred years. The Etz Yosef explains that the deeper meaning behind this is that the tree was growing and growing, as to serve as a shield before men, and guide them so to speak (see also: Matnot Kehunah). According to the <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Bereishit_Rabbah.15.6?lang=bi&with=Yefeh%20To%27ar&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Yefeh To'ar</a>, the whole concept of the etz hachayim is that it refers to the Torah.</p>\n<h2>How many fruits did it have?</h2>\n<p>In <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Pri_Etz_Hadar.4.23?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Pri Etz Hadar</a>, from the teachings of the Ari HaKadosh, it is written that the etz hachayim, the tree of life, had 12 (different?) fruits:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Wherever all thirty of the fruits mentioned above, whose roots are in the worlds of Creation, Formation, and Making, can be found, it is a mitzvah to obtain them. For whoever does much is surely worthy of praise. However, wherever they are not all available, there should be no less than twelve types of fruit, corresponding to the fruit of the supernal tree, the Tree of Life. It is established as a Holy Tree in twelve directions, the secret of the twelve permutations of the Name, YHVH. For each of these the kavvanah should be one of the twelve permutations, according to the order mentioned above .</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: -1)\n\n<p>It's much more supernal than an earthy tree, as is everything there in Bereishit, all extremely lofty things.

There, the EH is generally the Amuda Emtzaita (Central Column, Pillar), an attribute of H\"Y that unites all the worlds, like the Waw that unites His Name.</p>\n<p>However the Intro (daf 2b)  mentions that the Lulab represents Tzaddik (and the three Hadassim the Avot, and two Aravot the two Prophets of Truth, and Etrog - Shekhina) -- so as far as earthly trees go, that's probably the strongest association and model, namely a <strong>date palm.</strong></p>\n<p>The 41 occurrences are listed below, and some are translated.

for me it's clearer in this answer:<br>\nPer Prov. 11:30 <strong>Etz haChayim is the Torah, which is the fruit of the Tzadiq.</strong>\nPer Likutei Moharan II, Hosafot Manuscript #5.\n<a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/a/120825/11675\">https://judaism.stackexchange.com/a/120825/11675</a></p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: -2)\n\n<p>In general, this is dealing with the subject of <em>the Garden</em> (<strong>גן</strong>) which G-d planted in the preceding posuk. Like the expression of the Sages, G-d looked into the Torah and created the universe. In keeping with that structure, there are 53 parshiyot to the Torah (ג״ן פרשיות לתורה) like is found in chapter 3 of Likut Amarim v'Pitgamei Kodesh. </p>\n\n<p>Looking at the posuk you cite, there are several ideas that need to be noted.</p>\n\n<p>First is that G-d caused <em>the whole of the tree</em> (כל-עץ) to sprout from the <em>earth</em> (האדמה). The expression of כל has a connotation of <em>the whole</em> or a wholistic perspective. It also has meaning of <em>enclosed</em> or <em>enwrapped</em>. That implies an external quality as is noted from the continuing comment <em>pleasant in appearance</em>. Appearance is the external aspect which is communicated to others.</p>\n\n<p>The word <em>the earth</em> (<strong>האדמה</strong>) alludes to both the first human, Adam HaRishon (<strong>אדם</strong> הראשון) and more specifically, because it is a feminine word form, has an allusion to the feminine aspect, the woman who was formed from Adam.</p>\n\n<p>Isaiah 14:14 explains that the name Adam (<strong>אדם</strong>), has an indication of <em>similar to Heaven</em> (<strong>אדומה</strong> לעליון). That by observing ourselves (the Microcosmos) carefully, we can understand the system with which G-d established the universe (the Macrocosmos), like is found in Job 19:26.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>ואחר עורי נקפו זאת ומבשרי אחזה אלוה</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>All of the above preface follows what is found in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Be'er_Mayim_Chaim,_Genesis.1.26.24/he/Be'er_Mayim_Chaim,_Jerusalem_1991.?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Be'er Mayim Chayim to Bereshit 1:26:24</a>.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><strong>בצלמנו כדמותנו.</strong> צריך להבין למה בבריאתו לא נאמר כי אם בצלם אלהים עשה אותו ולא נאמר בצלם ודמות אלהים. גם צריך לדעת מהו הצלם ומהו הדמות. ויתכן לומר כי הנה <strong><em>עיקר בריאת האדם היה בכדי לְהִדָמוֹת עצמו לבוראו</em></strong> ככל אשר יוכל, וכמאמרם בשוחר טוב (מזמור א') חזקיהו ברבי חייא אמר <strong><em>אשריהם הצדיקים שמדמין את הצורה ליוצרה</em></strong> ואת הנטיעה לנוטעה כו' עד כאן. ואמרו (בבראשית רבה ע\"ט, ח') בפסוק (בראשית ל\"ג, כ') ויקרא לו אל אלהי ישראל, <strong><em>אתה אלוה בעליונים ואני אלוה בתחתונים.</em></strong> ולהבינך ענין זה שיקרא אדם אלהים, הוא כי איתא בזוה\"ק כמה פעמים (חלק ג', ע\"ג.) <strong><em>אורייתא וקודשא בריך הוא וישראל חד הוא</em></strong>, והענין הוא כי <strong><em>רמ\"ח אברי האדם ושס\"ה גידיו הן הן מכוונין לעולם הגדול</em></strong> הנקרא בפי החכמים שיעור קומה של יוצר בראשית כמאמר הכתוב (איוב י\"ט, כ\"ו) <strong><em>ומבשרי אחזה אלוה. כי על כן נקרא אדם מבחינת אדמה לעליון</em></strong> (ישעיה י\"ד, י\"ד) כמו שכתב בשל\"ה הקדוש <strong><em>והוא הציור של כל העולמות שלמעלה ושלמטה בסוד נשמתו וגופו, ונברא ליחד ולקשר כל אבר ואבר מרמ\"ח אבריו וכל שס\"ה גידיו אל רמ\"ח איברים ושס\"ה גידים העליונים</em></strong> הרמוזים בשיעור קומה הנזכר, ויזכה להיות מרכבה אליהם ואז כאשר יהיה מקושר ומדובק ברמ\"ח אברים ושס\"ה גידים העליונים אשר הוא מכוון נגדם אז תוכל שיעור קומה עליונה להוריק ולהשפיע אליו כל טוב וברכה כאשר יוכל שאת <strong><em>וזה עיקר כיוון הבריאה להיטיב לברואיו</em></strong>.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>With that in mind, the conclusion of the posuk can be considered. The <em>Tree of Life</em> and the <em>Tree of Knowledge</em>, in contrast to the wholistic aspect of <em>Tree</em>, correspond to the inner aspect of the Garden (<strong>בתוך הגן</strong>). They are the inner, driving meaning behind the external aspects of <em>appearance</em>.</p>\n\n<p>Looking at the idea of <em>Tree of Life</em> and <em>Tree of Knowledge</em> as it pertains to the human being can help to understand the <em>type of tree</em>.</p>\n\n<p>Surprisingly, these two expressions appear in regard to human anatomy.</p>\n\n<p>The <em>Tree of Life</em> is the term used to describe the folds in the inner wall of the uterus (<a href=\"https://www.glowm.com/resources/glowm/cd/pages/v1/v1c002.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Arbor Vitae Uterini</a>).</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>A vertical fold is present on the anterior and posterior cervical walls; from these, oblique folds radiate. These folds have been called the arbor vitae uteri or plicae palmatae.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><em>Tree of Life</em> also appears in regard to the anatomy of the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arbor_vitae_(anatomy)\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">human brain</a>. (Arbor Vitae) It is the inner, white matter of the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cerebellum\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Cerebellum</a> which also has a branching, tree-like appearance.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>In humans, the cerebellum plays an important role in motor control, and it may also be involved in some cognitive functions such as attention and language as well as in regulating fear and pleasure responses,<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arbor_vitae_(anatomy)\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">3</a> but its movement-related functions are the most solidly established. The human cerebellum does not initiate movement, but contributes to coordination, precision, and accurate timing: it receives input from sensory systems of the spinal cord and from other parts of the brain, and integrates these inputs to fine-tune motor activity.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>These two details of human anatomy allude to the underlying, driving concepts behind creation and are the <em>type of tree</em>. Discussion of this as it relates to the language in the posuk you cite can be found in Sefer Meorot Natan (מאורת נתן, מערכת ע) <a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=33030&st=&pgnum=131\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Chapter 11: Eden</a>, <a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=33030&st=&pgnum=132\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Chapter 17: Eitz</a> and <a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=33030&st=&pgnum=133\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Chapter 34: Oneg</a>.</p>\n\n<p>And so what is communicated through this posuk is that the womb, <em>the source and vehicle of life</em> and intellect are the <em>type of the tree</em> and are the inner driving forces behind G-d's creation.</p>\n\n\n",

What type of cat was this that was big enough to be eating a goat?</p>\n<p>My understanding from reading various articles is that this song was composed around the 1500s in Europe though there is no consensus on that.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>The entire piyyut is to be taken allegorically, with the little goad (chad gadya) representing Israel, the father Hashem, and the two zuzim the  two stone tablets (the Luchot). </p>\n\n<p>From <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chad_Gadya\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Wikipedia</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>As with any work of verse, Chad Gadya is open to interpretation. According to some modern Jewish commentators, what appears to be a light-hearted song may be symbolic. One interpretation is that Chad Gadya is about the different nations that have conquered the Land of Israel: The kid symbolizes the Jewish people, the cat, Assyria; the dog, Babylon; the stick, Persia; the fire, Macedonia; the water, Roman Empire; the ox, the Saracens; the slaughterer, the Crusaders; the angel of death, the Turks. At the end, God returns to send the Jews back to Israel. The recurring refrain of 'two zuzim' is a reference to the two stone tablets given to Moses on Mount Sinai (or refer to Moses and Aaron). Apparently this interpretation was first widely published in pamphlet published in 1731 in Leipzig by Philip Nicodemus Lebrecht. This interpretation has become quite popular, with many variations of which oppressor is represented by which character in the song.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The entire article there is quite interesting; noting how the author's Aramaic skills were lacking and how there is terrible grammar used throughout the song (and has been corrected in many texts). </p>\n\n<p>In a more literal sense, which is what you asked, there are many cats large enough to eat goat kids, notably the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bobcat\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">bobcat</a>, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lion\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">lion</a>, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiger\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">tiger</a>, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cougar\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">mountain lion</a>, etc. And nowhere does the song say that the cat ate the goat whole. I'm sure even my family's own pet cats could eat a goat kid if they were hungry enough. </p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>This is pure metaphorical.</p>\n<p>Rabbi Benjamin David Rabinowitz in his work <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Pesach_Haggadah%2C_Nirtzah%2C_Chad_Gadya.2?vhe=Pesach_Haggadah&lang=bi&with=Ephod%20Bad&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\"Ephod Bad\"</a> on the Haggadah explains that this is an reference to the Talmudic statement that a dog recognises its master, while a cat does not <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Horayot.13a.23?ven=William_Davidson_Edition_-_English&lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">(Horayot 13a)</a>. Rabbi Rabinowitz then goes on to explain what \"Then came a cat and ate the kid\" means.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Despite G-d's redemption of Israel from Egypt, Amalek came up with a plan to get around G-d's protection of Israel by attacking the weakest of them.\nYet Israel was even worse. <strong>The Israelites refused to recognize their Master in Heaven and cast doubt on G-d, and they acted like a cat who does not know its own master.</strong> (emphasis mine)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Amalek, the Ephod Bad says, is a reference to the dog, while the Israelites were a reference to the cat.</p>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Pesach_Haggadah%2C_Nirtzah%2C_Chad_Gadya.1?vhe=Pesach_Haggadah&lang=bi&with=Minchat%20Ani&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Minchat Ani</a> writes that the goat symbolises Esav.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The goat is a symbol of Esau while the lamb is a symbol of Jacob</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# \"You're married to my half\" (Kiddushin 7a) - how come?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>The Gemorah  (Kiddushin 7a) renders the expression \"You're married to my half\"  valid for kiddushin, deciding that she's acquired to him as whole for the sake of kiddushin itself, but does not add detail on practical ramification.\nRambam writes an interesting addition (Ishut 3, 9)<a href=\"http://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/952876/jewish/Ishut-Chapter-Three.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>האומר לאשה התקדשי לחציי הרי זו מקודשת.<br>\n  הא למה זה דומה לאומר לה תהי אשתי את ואחרת \n  <strong>שנמצא שאין לה אלא חצי איש</strong>. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>This raises the question: what's the effect of such an arrangement? Any man is allowed to marry additional women without his existing wife's consent. Does it mean he's obligated half the <em>Oyna</em> and half the <em>Mezoynos</em> and <em>Kesuso</em>? Does it start right away? What if he says \"Marry one fourth or one hundredth of me\"?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>From the way <a href=\"http://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/952876/jewish/Ishut-Chapter-Three.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rambam Ishut 3:9</a> is written, she is completely <em>mekudash</em> to the man. The <em>half</em> just means that he is using language as if he had married two women (which is allowed). <strong>Thus, they are married completely and there would be no <em>nafka minah</em> in the matter</strong>.</p>\n\n<p>The Rambam (as I read it) says that once the kiddushin \"takes hold\" it is considered a full kiddushin and must follow all the appropriate halachos as it says in the <a href=\"http://www.chabad.org/library/bible_cdo/aid/9882#v=10&showrashi=true\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">pasuk</a>. I understand the analogy to be as if he had been married to two wives and one of them had died or been divorced. The remaining wife is in the same situation as the wife <em>married by half</em>.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>If he takes another [wife] for himself, he shall not diminish her\n  sustenance, her clothing, or her marital relations.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Note that if he had married two women, he would be required to share his time between them and provide for them both. <em>Mezonos</em> means the living expenses of the household, however many women are involved. A man married to two women does not spend twice as much on living expenses. That is, a man married to two women, who then divorces one of them, does not still only spend half his time with the wife that remains. This case, would be considered as similar to that situation. As a result, once she is completely <em>mekudash</em> to him, she is treated in every respect as his full wife.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/952888/jewish/Ishut-Chapter-Fourteen.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rambam Hilchos Ishut 10:4</a> shows what is done if he is married to two wives as far as conjugal rights. Halacha 3 shows that he must fully fund the household of each of his wives in any case. Thus, <em>marrying half</em> would not decrease the <em>mezonos</em> that he is responsible for.</p>\n\n<p>We see <a href=\"https://www.ou.org/torah/mitzvot/taryag/mitzvah46/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>This mitzvah applies in all times and all places, but only to men. It\n  is discussed in the Talmud in the fourth and fifth chapters of\n  Kesubos. In the Shulchan Aruch, it is found in Orach Chaim 240. It is\n  number 262 of the 365 negative mitzvos in the Rambam’s Sefer HaMitzvos and \n  number42 of the 194 negative mitzvos that can be fulfilled today in the\n  Chofetz Chaim’s Sefer HaMitzvos HaKatzar.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The second half of the halacha shows under what circumstance the <em>kiddushin</em> does not take hold at all.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>When a man tells a woman, \"Become consecrated to my half,\" she is\n  consecrated. To what can this be compared? To his saying, \"May you\n  become my wife, and also another woman.\" And so, she has only half a\n  man.</p>\n  \n  <p>If, however, he said: \"Half of you is consecrated to me,\" she is not\n  consecrated. For a woman cannot be consecrated to two men. Similarly,\n  if he says, \"Behold, you are consecrated to me and to him,\" the woman\n  is not consecrated.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

In fact, already in Rav Hai Gaon's day the author's identity was unknown (!), as he wrote (<a href=\"https://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=21195&st=&pgnum=152\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Teshuvot Ha'Geonim, siman 248</a>):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"אין אנו יודעים תרגום ארץ ישראל מי אמרו.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Translation: \"We do not who authored the Targum of Eretz Yisrael.\"</p>\n<p>However, in his time there were people who had a tradition that even some of the greatest of the Amoraim of Eretz Yisrael used it, making it an ancient targum on par with Targum Onkelus (!). Granted, though, it is unknown whether Rav Hai was referring to Pseudo-Yonatan or to what's now known as \"Targum Neofiti\".</p>\n<p>According to <a href=\"https://forum.otzar.org/download/file.php?id=33221&sid=e8996d9a91cfde62f1ee50fdf5b34ee1\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">this article</a> in Mishpacha (which also brought the quote by Rav Hai), it is generally accepted that the author or authors were sages in Eretz Yisrael. As many sources over the generations called it \"Targum Yerushalmi\", it is believed these sages lived in Yerushalayim. The article brings a few opinions attempting to narrow down the authorship a little more:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bernard_Revel\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rabbi Bernard Revel</a> thought it was created by Eretz Yisrael sages of the 8th or 9th century, as a reaction to wrongful translations inserted into targums by local Karaites (similar to what some believed they had done to the Talmud Yerushalmi - see <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/109039/source-of-opinion-that-talmud-yerushalmi-was-corrupted-by-karaites/118942#118942\">here</a>).</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Menachem_Mendel_Kasher\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rabbi Menachem Kasher</a> disagreed with Rabbi Revel, being that there are many instances in the Targum that simply do not make sense as anti-Karaite measures, per Rabbi Revel's view, and secondly, that if such a targum project was started around Rasag's time, why is it not mentioned in any of his or his contemporaries' writings? And thirdly, there are sources (such as Rav Hai, brought above) that date it to much earlier.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Some scholars (nameless in the article) believe that the Targum was written no earlier than the late Savoraic-early Gaonaic period, being that there are instances in which the Targum mentions historical facts only relevant to later periods, such as the names of Yishmael's wives being the same names as Muhammad's wife and daughter (see <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Genesis.21.21?lang=bi&aliyot=0&p2=Targum_Jonathan_on_Genesis.21.21&lang2=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Targum on Beresheet 21:21</a>). However, the article points out that at best, this is evidence that there are later <strong>layers</strong> in the Targum, but it's not evidence that the entire work can be dated to a later period.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>See <a href=\"https://forum.otzar.org/viewtopic.php?t=51400#p274358\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a> for a summary of the article in Hebrew.</p>\n<p>Academic scholars nowadays seem to generally argue for later and later periods of composition, although the Mishpacha article's note on this (that this reflects later <em>additions</em> to the original material), in my humble opinion, is still valid:</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://huc.edu/directory/stephen-kaufman\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Professor Stephen Kaufman</a> in his essay \"<a href=\"https://brill.com/view/journals/arst/11/1/article-p1_1.xml?rskey=NmToPN&result=1\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Targum Pseudo-Jonathan and Late Jewish Literary Aramaic</a>\", Aramaic Studies 11, argues that the Targum is an amalgamation of several different older targums, including Onkelos and Neofiti, together with chutz-la'aretz (outside of Eretz Yisrael) targums. For this reason, together with his deeper analysis in the essay, he surmises that the author lived somewhere between the 6th and 9th centuries, somewhere in the area of Eretz Yisrael or Syria (i.e., not necessarily in Eretz Yisrael), but it is difficult to narrow it down more. Similarly, in <a href=\"https://dash.harvard.edu/bitstream/handle/1/33493504/ZHAKEVICH-DISSERTATION-2016.pdf?sequence=4&isAllowed=y\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">this essay</a> by Dr. Iosef Zhakevich, several opinions are brought that state that the author of the Targum wasn't so much an author than he was a <em>compiler</em>.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://bible.biu.ac.il/en/node/658\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Dr. Leeor Gottlieb</a> in his essay \"<a href=\"https://brill.com/view/journals/arst/19/1/article-p104_7.xml?rskey=CNOpk1&result=2#d66099153e1234\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Towards a More Precise Understanding of Pseudo-Jonathan’s Origins</a>\", Aramaic Studies 19, argues for a much later dating of the work and a vastly different location. In his view, it was authored in 12th-century Italy (!!!). This is pretty much the view that <a href=\"https://ulaval.academia.edu/GavinMcDowell\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Gavin McDowell</a> suggests in his essay \"<a href=\"https://brill.com/view/journals/arst/19/1/article-p121_8.xml?rskey=CNOpk1&result=1#d66100367e1642\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">The Date and Provenance of Targum Pseudo-Jonathan: The Evidence of Pirqe deRabbi Eliezer and the Chronicles of Moses</a>\", Aramaic Studies 19. He even goes as far as to suggest a person who would have had the necessarily tools and materials to compile such a work: <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Menahem_ben_Solomon\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rabbi Menachem ben Shlomo</a>, though he doesn't outright state that he believes that <em>he</em> was the author of the work. In his words:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"It could be the work of a single author. Menahem b. Solomon, for example, had all the necessary resources to produce a text like Targum Pseudo-Jonathan. First, he knew a Palestinian Targum similar to the one that must have served as the base of Pseudo-Jonathan. Second, he knew Targum Onqelos, which he cites in Sekel Ṭob. Third, he was conversant with the entire rabbinic corpus, not only the classical canon of Talmud and Midrash but also later works such as PRE [Pirkei D'Rabbi Eliezer]. He also seems to have known the Chronicles of Moses: While discussing the fourth plague, he refers to the silonit (‮סילונית‬‎), an extremely rare word which, in the Chronicles of Moses, designates a sea monster that ravaged Egypt during this plague. That an Italian author such as Menahem b. Solomon might compose an original Aramaic work at such a late date, although unusual, is not more so than the appearance of the Zohar in thirteenth-century Spain.\"<sup>1</sup></p>\n</blockquote>\n<hr />\n<p><sup>1</sup> It's interesting that the validity of such a late dating of the Targum hinges, according to McDowell, on the supposed late dating of the Zohar. It appears that strong-enough arguments against the late dating of the Zohar would also significantly weaken late datings of the Targum as well. See <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/a/34307/20472\">here</a> and <a href=\"http://www.machonso.org/hamaayan/?gilayon=61&id=1812\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a> for some arguments for the earlier dating of the Zohar.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Isn't Rava's reaction here a bit harsh?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>In B. Ketuvot 63a, we learn the following story (translation with commentary from R. Adin Steinsaltz):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>רב יוסף בריה דרבא שדריה אבוהי לבי רב לקמיה דרב יוסף פסקו ליה שית שני כי הוה תלת שני מטא מעלי יומא דכפורי אמר איזיל ואיחזינהו לאינשי ביתי שמע אבוהי שקל מנא ונפק לאפיה <strong>אמר ליה זונתך נזכרת?</strong> איכא דאמרי אמר ליה יונתך נזכרת איטרוד לא מר איפסיק ולא מר איפסיק:</p>\n<p>On the same subject it is related: Rav Yosef, son of Rava, was sent by his father to the study hall to learn before the great Sage Rav Yosef. They agreed that he should sit for six years in the study hall. When three years had passed, the eve of Yom Kippur arrived and he said: I will go and see the members of my household, meaning his wife. His father heard and took a weapon, as if he were going to war, and went to meet him. According to one version he said to him: <strong>Did you remember your mistress,</strong> as you are abandoning your studies to see a woman? (The Maharsha has the girsa of \"your partner/זוגתך\".) There are those who say that he said to him: Did you remember your dove? Since both father and son were involved in an argument, they were preoccupied and this Master did not eat the cessation meal before Yom Kippur and that Master also did not eat the cessation meal that day.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Isn't that a bit of an excessive reaction? A grown man, after spending three years of his life in learning, wishes to visit his home Erev Yom Kippur for one day. His father becomes infuriated, calls his son's wife a harlot, and tells him to go back to Yeshiva! Isn't it healthy for him to maintain a warm relationship with his spouse - how bad could it be for him to spend one afternoon with his household?</p>\n<p>(See also B. Ketuvot 62b and Bereishit Rabba 95 for similar instances of very infrequent relationships between rabbinical colleagues and their spouses.)</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>I think you can understand his attitude from Rashbi's outlook when he left the cave after 12 years of continuous study (and meditation of some kind) (Shabbat 33).

If you talk to righteous frum bachurim (if you can find some) that do not read newspapers, don't watch TV have no idea of Internet, and ask them about their attitude to their forthcoming marriage, you will get similar answers.

However, I'm citing from <a href=\"http://baisdovyosef.com/faq/11-taking-food-home-from-a-shiva-house-2/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">this article</a> that says:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>There are Poskim who opine that nothing, whether objects or food,\n  should be taken out of the place of mourning <strong>during the entire Shivah</strong>,\n  as a Ruach Raah (unfavourable spiritual influence) rest on the abode\n  (Eliahu Rabah 224,7. Lechem Haponim 376). Some rule that the\n  restriction applies only if the death happened in that home otherwise\n  it in not relevant (Chidushei Rabbi Akiva Eiger 37). Other authorities\n  state that this tradition has no Halachick basis at all. (Yosef Ometz\n  p.330), Nitey Gabriel 92,1 writes that this seems to be the accepted\n  custom. When the prohibition of B’al Taschis (discarding good usable\n  food) is also involved, this last one would have priority.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I've bolded the critical phrase, here. It seems that the custom exists only during the shiva period, and the author has cited Eliahu Rabbah for the source of that minhag. So, it seems that once the shiva is over, the <em>Ruach Ra'ah</em> is no longer present. </p>\n\n<p>Even during the shiva week, depending on the amount of food and when it was brought, there may be a good chance that these left-overs would be disposed of, anyway. In such a case, you would be doing a mitzvah if you took it and ate it yourself or gave it to someone else, esp. a needy hungry person. However, as the mourners themselves should not be occupied with anything other than the mourning, I think it's improper to ask them, directly. Usually, a non-mourning relative or someone else is in charge, and proper etiquette seems not to ask at all, but if someone hints to you to take the leftovers esp. if they mention that it will be disposed, I can't see a reason to refuse the offer.</p>\n\n\n",

At the time of the exchange of the birthright, they were unaware that blessings were slated for the firstborn. Accordingly, the exchange was null and void since Esav never intended to forfeit the blessings. Accordingly, in Esav's view, Ya'akov was guilty of two crimes: initially taking advantage of him to get the birthright, and later maintaining his status to get the blessings even though the exchange wasn't meant to include that (See <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shlomo_Ephraim_Luntschitz\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">K'li Y'kar</a> here).</p>\n\n\n",

Yom Kippur atones for transgressions between a person and God, but for a transgression against one's neighbor, Yom Kipur cannot atone, until he appeases his neighbor. Thus R. Eleazar ben Azariah expounds the text, \"From all your sins before the Lord shall ye be clean\": For transgressions between a person and God, Yom Kippur atones, for transgressions against one's neighbor, Yom Kippur cannot atone, until he appeases his neighbor. R. Akiva says, Happy are you, Israel! Before whom are you purified, and who purifies you [of your transgressions]? Your Father Who is in heaven. For it is said, \"Then will I sprinkle clean water upon you, and ye shall be clean\"; and it is also said, \"The ‏ritual bath‎ [lit.

And anyone who brings the many to sin is not given enough [time] to repent. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Yoma.87a.6?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Gemara</a> says that the reason is:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>וכל המחטיא את הרבים אין מספיקין בידו לעשות תשובה שלא יהא הוא בגן עדן ותלמידיו בגיהנם שנאמר (משלי כח, יז) אדם עשוק בדם נפש עד בור ינוס אל יתמכו בו</p>\n  \n  <p>On the other hand, whoever causes the public to sin has almost no ability to repent, so that he will not be in the Garden of Eden while his students are in Gehenna, as it is stated: “A man who is laden with the blood of any person shall hasten his steps to the pit; none will support him” (Proverbs 28:17). Since he oppressed others and caused them to sin, he shall have no escape. </p>\n</blockquote></li>\n</ol>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>However, there are a few counter-points:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p>While one can't undo his actions and undo the Mamzer's creation[1], if one repents he is still considered a good Jew, as the Gemara says in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Yevamot.22b.9?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Yevamos</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>והאי בר תשובה הוא והתנן שמעון בן מנסיא אומר איזהו (קהלת א, טו) מעוות לא יוכל לתקון זה הבא על הערוה והוליד ממנה ממזר השתא מיהא עושה מעשה עמך הוא: </p>\n  \n  <p>The Gemara objects: Is he in fact able to repent after fathering a mamzer? Didn’t we learn in a mishna that Shimon ben Menasya says: Which is: “That which is crooked cannot be made straight” (Ecclesiastes 1:15)? This is referring to one who engaged in intercourse with a relative who is forbidden to him and fathered a mamzer with her. This implies that he has no possibility of achieving total repentance. The Gemara responds: At least now, after repenting, he is considered as one who acts according to the deeds of your people. Although he cannot totally rectify his transgression, his child is liable to receive punishment for cursing or hitting him. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<ol start=\"2\">\n<li>The Ikkar Tosfos Yom Tov writes:</li>\n</ol>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>כמו אמרם אין מספיקין בידו לעשות תשובה. ולפיכך לא יעזרהו השם שיעשה בצום כפור מה שראוי לו לעשות כדי שיכפרו לו עונותיו באותו היום.\n  Hashem won't help him have a proper Yom Kippur so he won't achieve atonement. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Though one can imply (As Rabbi Shneur Zalman of Liadi <a href=\"http://www.chabad.org/library/tanya/tanya_cdo/aid/1029251/jewish/Chapter-11.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">did</a>) that </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>ואף גם זאת \"אין מספיקין\" דייקא; אבל אם דחק ונתחזק ונתגבר על יצרו ועשה תשובה, מקבלין תשובתו.\n  Withal he is not granted an opportunity. But if he pressed forcefully and overpowered his evil impulse and did repent, then his repentance is accepted.</p>\n</blockquote></li>\n</ol>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>I'm just offering a completely different approach to this question.</p>\n\n<p>From our sources it is clear that <strong>there are two different ways of Teshuva</strong> - one being strictly Halakhic and established and the other being kind of miraculous, Hashem aided.</p>\n\n<p>THe first is well defined by Rambam's Hilkhos Teshuva and everyone that follows them knows exactly what's expected and when he's completely forgiven (if anything).</p>\n\n<p>The later leaves Hashem an option to override those rules and offers a shortcut to a full Teshuvah (thru Hashem's forgiveness) in cases where the established Halakha sees no way of repent. Those are the cases with R' Elazar ben Dordaysh, Menashe and others.</p>\n\n<p>That teaches us \"עת לעשות לה' - this is the Halakha, but \"הפירו תורתך\" it is always possible to override it (Tehhilim 119).</p>\n\n\n",

He frames it as follows:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p><strong>Honesty (<em>emet</em>)</strong> requires one to be truthful in his dealings and one may not deceive someone about a shidduch by misinforming the other party - he notes however there might be allowances not to disclose everything to avoid creating disputes (<em>machlokes</em>), embarrassing someone or hurting a person’s feelings or reputation</p></li>\n<li><p><strong>Not misleading someone (<em>geneivat daat</em>)</strong> means not overselling one party in a shidduch or making false promises</p></li>\n<li><p><strong>Fraud (<em>onaah</em>)</strong> means one must notify the other party of information that might be of concern. He quotes Sefer Chassidim (<a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=45917&st=&pgnum=124\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">507</a>) that \"do not hide medical issues from the other party to which they would object enough to decline the shidduch\"</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>He also notes shidduchim are subject to some exceptions</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>One is not required to disclose a problem the other party could discover, e.g., if the scandalous activities of a family member are well known in one’s hometown, one need not tell the other party since this information could be discovered by asking around</li>\n<li>Insignificant information: shidduchim do not require revealing every possible medical or yichus issue. The Chofetz Chaim distinguishes between a medical issue one must reveal and a \"weakness,\" which one need not. Thus, someone need not reveal minor ailments that would not disturb the average person.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>In most instances, there is no requirement to notify the other party or a shadchan of any of these blemishes at the time a shidduch is suggested. Many contemporary poskim contend that one should reveal this information after the couple has met a few times - about the time the relationship is beginning to get serious.</p>\n\n<p><strong>To come back to your question therefore, one has to disclose significant hidden blemishes that would be of concern to the other party once the relation gets serious.</strong></p>\n\n<p>See the <a href=\"http://www.yeshiva.co/midrash/outershiur.asp?id=9175\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">original</a> for sources and more examples.</p>\n\n<p>See also <a href=\"http://www.koltorah.org/ravj/12-12%20%C2%A0Revealing%20Flaws%20of%20a%20Potential%20Marriage%20Partner.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">a similar compilation</a> from R Chaim Jachter with more sources and examples of blemishes to be disclosed (e.g., significant diseases, reproductive issues)</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Is AGI possible according to Judaism?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>Artificial Intelligence is a hot topic right now, and AGI \"General Intelligence\" has always <em>just</em> been a couple of decades away. So I've been wondering: We believe that a human differs from an animal because we have a neshama, and this grants us a higher intelligence. If so, is \"General intelligence\" possible? Or will it never happen, because our computer program won't have a soul, leaving it on the level of an animal?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>This bothers me a lot also, and here's what I propose:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Simple, self learning computer systems (AIs) already exist, so they are compatible with Judaism de facto. To jump into an AGI world we would need a definition for intelligence or consciousness. As for now, we, humans, don't have a clear definition for consciousness, for us to be able to judge other beings (animate or inanimate) on this scale.</li>\n<li>General AI is a concept, a speculation, based on the general theory of evolution, <strong>proposing a natural emergence of consciousness as a process of self-evolving inanimate matter based on exponential increase in processing power</strong> (human brains). The logic is simple, if spontaneous mutations in inanimate DNA lead necessarily to appearance of conscious beings like humans, a growing self sophisticating digital system can reach it too, once it reaches the same level of processing power (see Ray Kurzweil's logic).</li>\n<li>This point was never proven, just like with the Evolution theory. This is exactly where we part - Judaism and \"Science\". We claim, <strong>that any inanimate system, indistinguishable from a human being as it can be (see <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_test\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">the Turing test</a>) will never be \"humanly\" conscious</strong>. See the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_room\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">China room thought experiment</a>.   Therefore, in my understanding, AI does not pose a challenge to Judaism, as it presents nothing new.</li>\n<li>According to many apocalyptic views by leading scientists, philosophers and entrepreneurs (citations needed), the humanity will reach the point of (<em>possibility of</em>) mass extinction long before the full grown AGI will emerge. May I remind you, <strong>we only need one machine going haywire</strong> to spur the prophecies of the Messianic days and Gog and Magog wars. This is where it perfectly fits. It also seems the most plausible scenario to me.</li>\n</ol>\n\n\n",

As a\n  result the <em>Tzadik</em> never sins, does only good deeds and <em>mitzvot</em> and\n  has absolutely no desire or interest in anything outside the realm of\n  holiness, <em>mitzvot</em>, and goodness - not in his actions, words, or even\n  a single thought.</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

From there, all things are revealed, and through those spiritual channels, severity is tempered with mercy before descending to the lower worlds.</p>\n<p>The author Rav Aharon Dovid writes there:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>ומ''ש גלוי וידוע לפני כסא כבודך, הוא בעולם האצילות, אשר הוא יותר פנימי מכסא הכבוד, שהוא הבריאה. וזמ''ש לפני כסא כבודך, ומשם נגלים וידועים בחינת הנקבים האלו, למתקם משם, ע''י הנקבים ההם, מן האצילות היושב פנימי מן כסא כבודך, שהוא הבריאה כנזכר</p>\n<p>“And that which it says, ‘It is revealed and known before the Throne of Your Glory’ — this refers to the World of Atzilus (Emanation), which is more inward than the Throne of Glory, which is [identified with] Beriah (the World of Creation). And this is what is meant by the phrase ‘before the Throne of Your Glory’ — that from there are revealed and known these aspects of the ‘openings,’ in order to sweeten [the judgements] through them, from Atzilus, which is situated inward of the Throne of Glory, which is Beriah, as mentioned.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>For the uninitiated:\nIn Kabbalah, the universe is described as existing in four great spiritual realms: Atzilus (Emanation), Beriah (Creation), Yetzirah (Formation), and Asiyah (Action) (See the Baal Sulam - Yehuda Ashlag explain it in more detail in his <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Petichah_LeChokhmat_HaKabbalah.3?vhe=hebrew%7CZohar_with_Sulam_commentary,_Jerusalem_1945&lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Pesicha LeChochmas HaKabbalah</a>) Each one is more “external” than the one above it, with Atzilus being closest to the Divine. The “Throne of Glory” is usually associated with the realm of Beriah. But the phrase “before the Throne of Your Glory” hints to something even deeper — in Atzilus, which lies inward and higher than Beriah. The “openings” (נקבים) are Kabbalistic symbols for channels through which Divine energy flows. Sometimes these channels are also the places where severity or harsh judgement can be revealed. From Atzilus, these channels are “sweetened”, meaning that harsh judgements are softened and transformed into compassion — before the energy flows down into Beriah and the lower worlds.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>In <a href=\"https://www.artscroll.com/Books/9781422609699.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Aleinu Leshabeiach, volume 3</a>, pages 117-118, Rav Zilberstein addresses this question. </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>We tend to think that Hashem’s Throne of Glory is a concept relegated to lofty spiritual matters, not to the mundane aspects of our lives. After all, the Throne of Glory is the seat of Hashem’s presence, the holiest possible point in the universe. </p>\n  \n  <p>It is interesting to note, however, that the Throne of Glory is mentioned in only one blessing, and that blessing relates to a very mundane, even lowly, aspect of life. The blessing is <em>Asher Yatzar</em>, recited after a person relieves himself. “It is obvious and known before Your Throne of Glory,” we say, “that if but one of them were to be ruptured...” This shows us that even the bodily functions that seem to be the furthest removed from holiness are under the direct supervision and care of Hashem. </p>\n  \n  <p>Hashem fashioned human beings in such a way that we have to relieve ourselves a number of times every day.

    "content": "# Why do many shuls have both a shulchan and an amud?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>Follow up to <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/q/44839/5275\">my question</a> about shul orientation.</p>\n\n<p>Why do many Ashkenazi shuls have both a <em>shulchan</em> (this is usually the larger Torah reader's table) as well as an <em>amud</em> (the smaller table used by the chazzan, usually located at the front of the shul)? Why don't they do both Torah reading and prayers at the shulchan? Is there a halacha or preference that prayers be done from the front of the shul? (The other question already explains that Torah reading should be done from the middle.)</p>\n\n<p>I have seen a number of shuls that have just a <em>shulchan</em>. These tend to be Conservative shuls. But most Orthodox shuls I have seen have both. </p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>All of the information from this answer comes from <a href=\"https://www.ou.org/torah/halacha/halacha-on-ou/one-pray-bima-amud/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">this article</a> from Orthodox Union. Please refer to this article for further reading. </p>\n\n<p>The bimah, or the platform from which the Torah is read, is placed on a raised platform for several reasons (you might be wondering where I'm going with this, but stay with me):</p>\n\n<p>An \"aliyah\" literally means an \"ascent\", and so when someone receives an aliyah (an ascent) to read the Torah he must literally ascend to where the Torah scroll is placed. Also, since the Torah was given on Har Sinai, which was held above Bnei Yisrael during Mattan Torah, the bimah is raised to commemorate this. </p>\n\n<p>There is also Scriptural support for having the bimah on a raised platform. When Ezra read the Torah to the people, he stood on a platform (<a href=\"http://www.mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt35b08.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Nehemiah 8:4</a>). Additionally, during the <a href=\"http://www.mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt0531.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Hakhel celebration</a>, the King would sit above the people as he read the Torah aloud. The bimah is also likened to the Altar, which was, generally speaking, a high platform. (The reason the bimah is placed in the middle of the synagogue is so all the congregants can see the Torah.)</p>\n\n<p>The amud, on the other hand, is the lectern from which the chazzan prays and leads the congregation. The amud is generally placed at the front of the synagogue by the Aron HaKodesh, and is unique to the Ashkenazi custom. The Sephardi custom is that the chazzan davens and the Torah is read from the same place, the bimah. </p>\n\n<p>There is a Polish custom to make the floor in front of the amud slightly lower than the rest of the floor, to fulfill the verse \"From the depths I called You, Hashem\" (<a href=\"http://www.mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt26d0.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Psalms 130:1</a>). This is derived from the Talmud (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Berakhot.10b.26?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Brachos 10b</a>), which states that one should not daven from a high place, but rather from a low place, citing the above verse from Psalm 130.</p>\n\n<p>The Shulchan Aruch (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Shulchan_Arukh,_Orach_Chayim.90.1?lang=bi&with=Berakhot&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">O.C 90:1</a>) also states that one should not daven from a high place. (See also <a href=\"https://he.wikisource.org/wiki/%D7%A9%D7%95%D7%9C%D7%97%D7%9F_%D7%A2%D7%A8%D7%95%D7%9A_%D7%90%D7%95%D7%A8%D7%97_%D7%97%D7%99%D7%99%D7%9D_%D7%A6\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Mechaber, Hilchos Tefillah, 90:1</a>.) And the Mishnah Berurah (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Mishnah_Berurah.90.3?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">90:3</a>) explains that the reason is because it is haughty to daven from a high place, and again, cites the verse from Psalm 130 above.</p>\n\n<p>So it is clear that the Ashkenazi opinion is that it is forbidden to daven from the bimah because of its high place on a raised platform. Please see the linked article for opinions that it is permitted, as well as the Sephardi opinion, etc. My job here was just to summarize the relevant contents of the article, for the convenience of others.</p>\n\n\n",

This obligation is derived from Dev 8:10 which reads וְאָכַלְתָּ֖ וְשָׂבָ֑עְתָּ וּבֵֽרַכְתָּ֙ (though in context, I wonder if the obligation should only be incumbent on people living in Israel).</p>\n\n<p>But Dev 11:15 only reads, \" וְאָכַלְתָּ֖ וְשָׂבָֽעְתָּ\" as does Dev 6:11.

Is there significance to the fact that 75% of the time that that behavior is described, there is no commandment to bless?</p>\n\n<p>I understand that there is an explicit commandment to bless but I might think that the fact that there are also explicit statements which choose <strong>not</strong> to demand blessing might present its own significance.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>I don't agree with your analogy to Dev. 8:12 as that is in the negative. Using your logic, that verse would imply \"Lest you eat and satiate yourself and therefore WOULDN'T bless!\" See the entire context of where that verse is placed. It's saying that you wouldn't thank G-d at all for all the food and houses and everything that he gave you, because you would think that it came from your own power and might. Why would it indicate any notion of blessing G-d, here?</p>\n\n<p>Furthermore, the verses in question discuss forgetting G-d and straying after foreign gods; this is the same notion in chapters 6 and 11 as well. Why would they bless G-d when they are forgetting Him? </p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=9617&st=&pgnum=123\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Ramba\"n on Devarim 8:10</a> has a novel explanation. He says that the reason for <em>Birkat Hamazon</em> is connected to a concept mentioned several verses before that. By saying <em>Birkat Hamazon</em>, you will recall the Exodus from Egypt.</p>\n\n<p>Therefore, in two of the \"counter\" verses that you mentioned (or nearby) we can understand why this idea (blessing) is omitted. In 8:14, it says \"Your heart will be raised, and you will forget G-d <strong>who took you out of Egypt</strong> from the house of slavery\".</p>\n\n<p>Likewise, in Devarim 6:12, it says, \"Watch yourself lest you forget G-d who <strong>took you out of Egypt from the house of slavery</strong>.\"</p>\n\n<p>So, there's a consistency to Ramban's reasoning. I am uncertain about Devarim 11:15, as there is no mention of the Exodus in surrounding verses.</p>\n\n\n",

Bartenura translates it as one who threatens to kill people if they don’t give him their land.</sup></p>\n\n<p>We have a general principle called Mitzvah HaBa’ah BeAveirah - a mitzvah performed by violating an aveirah - which is rejected (Sukkah 30a et. al.). Now, a thief is in violation of Lo Sasig, the prohibition against stealing land (see Rashi to Devarim 19:14, quoting Sifrei there), and the mugger is in violation of Lo Sachmod, the prohibition against coveting (see BM 5b). So why do we need to derive these cases from Shemos 23, when even had the passuk not been written we would have forbidden such Bikkurim?</p>\n\n<p>Granted, the passuk would have to have been written for the other cases in the Mishnah (sharecroppers, plus the various cases from Mishnah 1). My question is on the wording “they don’t bring for <em>this reason</em>” - implying that they don’t bring only because of this reason.

I understand the use of that name in the Megillah. However in our liturgy including the Al haNissim prayer and other songs and piyutim we continue to refer to her as Esther instead of Hadassah. We do not do this for other Jews who were given or assumed foreign names (ex. Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego). I would like to understand why we do not use Esther's Hebrew name in our prayers and piyutim. </p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>Main points and answers in <strong>Bold</strong>.</p>\n<p>There are many aspects that need to be discussed in order to properly answer this question, but this <strong>will only really be a question according to the (minor) minority opinion that your question is based on, that Esther is a foreign, name, whereas Hadassah is a Hebrew name</strong>.  This will be shown below.</p>\n<p>The answer according to that minority opinion is that @Mevaqesh is absolutely right - we likely developed this from the fact that <strong>(almost) all times that she is named in scripture, she is referred to as Esther</strong>.  This is compounded by the fact that we read Megillas Esther (note the name of the book!) yearly, and all of us are present to hear it, so we know her by that name.  This fact makes it different than all of the other cases mentioned in the question. (How many times have you heard of Shadrach?)</p>\n<p>Then we get to the actual understanding of the name Esther vs. the name Hadassah. Here is a short summary of <a href=\"http://mg.alhatorah.org/Full/Esther/2.7#e0n7\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">some of the commentaries</a> who deal with that in Megillas Esther, and the Gemara, and how their approaches will answer this question by disagreeing with the premise outlined above, or providing another answer:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Chazal (<a href=\"https://he.wikisource.org/wiki/%D7%9E%D7%92%D7%99%D7%9C%D7%94_%D7%99%D7%92_%D7%90\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Megillah 13a</a>) have a Machlokes which was her real name:</li>\n</ul>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>רבי מאיר אומר: אסתר שמה</strong>, ולמה נקרא שמה הדסה - על שם הצדיקים שנקראו הדסים, וכן הוא אומר (זכריה, א', ח') \"והוא עומד בין ההדסים\". <strong>רבי יהודה אומר: הדסה שמה</strong>, ולמה נקראת שמה אסתר - על שם שהייתה מסתרת דבריה, שנאמר \"אין אסתר מגדת את עמה וגו'\". <strong>רבי נחמיה אומר: הדסה שמה</strong>, ולמה נקראת אסתר - שהיו אומות העולם קורין אותה על שום אסתהר.\nבן עזאי אומר אסתר לא ארוכה ולא קצרה היתה <strong>אלא בינונית כהדסה</strong> ר' יהושע בן קרחה אמר <strong>אסתר ירקרוקת היתה</strong> וחוט של חסד משוך עליה</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Here is an outline of the 3 major opinions, as relevant to our discussion:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Rabbi Meir, Ben Azzai, Rabbi Yehoshua Ben Karchah - Her real name was Esther, and she is referred to as Hadassah for some Midrashic reason.</li>\n<li>Rabbi Yehudah - Her real name was Hadassah, but we refer to her as Esther because she hid her \"nationality\" and \"birth\".</li>\n<li>Rabbi Nechemiah - Her real name was Hadassah, and the non-Jews called her Esther.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>According to opinion 1 (what I would consider the Gemara's majority opinion), her only real name was Esther, and she was called Hadassah, so <strong>we refer to her as Esther because that was her real name</strong>.  According to opinion 2, we call her Esther in the Megillah because she hid her nationality from Achashveirosh, and therefore, <strong>we would continue calling her Esther from then on, despite it not being her real name</strong>.  Your question applies only to number 3.  I will bring other opinions to show that we do not seem to accept the view that Esther was simply her non-Jewish name. Note that there are other versions of the found in various Midrashim, with a few different reasons given, but the basics are the same. (This is where the idea of \"Hester Panim\" may fit in, similar to opinion 2.)</p>\n<p>Here are some other opinions that are not based on the Gemara (many Rishonim and Acharonim choose one of the opinions mentioned above and support it, see above for links to all of the commentaries):</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Ri Kara says that the word Hadassah is simply the word they used in Shushan to describe a young girl, <strong>and that her name was actually Esther</strong></li>\n<li>Ibn Ezra mentions multiple opinions (some in derash), but understands according to peshat that Esther is indeed a translation of Hadassah into Persian, according to the second opinion, <strong>the question must be addressed by our original answer</strong></li>\n<li>Rashbam seems to suggest that Hadassah was some sort of nickname for that Esther (how she was known), <strong>and that her name was actually Esther</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Edit: Shout out to @DoubleAA who essentially wrote this answer in the shortest way possible.  Shout out also to Ezra, who points out that she was much more known in her role as Queen Esther, even if her Hebrew name was Hadassah.</p>\n\n\n",

It is not a matter of expectation, but that Yaakov was a normal human being and did not change miraculously. Nor did Leah's <em>perception</em> of the family dynamics miraculously change as soon as each child was born. Each name was given to show what was going on in the family at that time.</p>\n\n<p>Leah realized that this was something that had to be worked on and she recognized the progress that was being made. Note that she uses the future tense, יֶֽאֱהָבַ֥נִי. Perhaps the English idiom could be, <em>will come to love me</em>. That is, now the feelings of resesentment for the <em>trick</em> will indeed fade and a loving relationship will become established.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>At first, כִּֽי־רָאָ֤ה יְהֹוָה֙ בְּעָנְיִ֔י So that up to then\n  Yaakov's preference for Rachel was <em>visible</em>. With the birth of Reuven\n  that disappeared, but to Leah's <em>ear</em>, it could still be detected.\n  Just in the tone of his voice to Rachel, Leah could feel that she\n  still did not posess the full measure of her husband's love, so she\n  called her second son Shimon.</p>\n  \n  <p>With the birth of her third son, however, she felt the difference had\n  quite disappeared, yea she felt she could now express with full\n  confidence that now, the purest truest loving relationship between\n  husband and wife was established, which is exactly the conception of\n  לויה. For לוה, הלוה, is that attachment of two persons where each one\n  feels themselves the לוה, the debtor of the other, feels that they owe\n  their happiness and whole life to the other. It is accordingly highly \n  significant that in Levi, it is not she, but he who expresses this in\n  giving the baby its name.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

Why were both of these necessary? What was the purpose of each of these that the other didn't accomplish?</p>\n\n<p>I couldn't locate anything on this in commentaries (used Mikra'ot Gedolot). I'd esp. be interested in the \"historical\" aspect of this practice. I'm assuming that at that time it was common for people to make a \"peace treaty\" by establishing a pile of stones. I somewhat understand this idea, here, as in verse 52, Lavan says that the stone pile should act as a \"border\" that neither side will cross that border to harm the other. But, again, why do we need both sets of rocks?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malbim\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Malbim</a> asks this question in his commentary to 31:45. He suggests that this was a two-part pact between Lavan and Ya'akov. They were treat each other properly both publicly and privately. The former can be supervised by other people, while the latter can only be overseen by God. The two monuments correspond to these two elements of the pact. The גל is supposed to be a large visible structure (note that it was composed of multiple stones, took multiple people to assemble, and was large enough for multiple people to sit and eat on) to remind witnesses to the pact of that pact, so that they keep the participants honest in their public dealings. The מצבה is to metaphorically \"remind God\" to supervise their private behaviour. It need not be large since it is only metaphorical. Furthermore, Malbim suggests that מצבות in particular were of religious significance at that time, so it was appropriate to serve as a \"reminder to God.\" Regarding this significance, note Genesis (28:22 and  35:14) and Leviticus (26:1).</p>\n\n<p>Interestingly, Malbim's explanation was largely anticipated by the Midrash B'Reshit Rabbati (Parashat Vayetse 31:48-50: pg. 144) which states:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>א\"ל לבן ב' דברים יש כאן מצבה והגל...כשם שהם ב' דברים כך אני מבקש שיהיו משמשין ב' עדויות. הגל הזה יהיה עד ביני וביניך שאתה לא תרע לי ולא לבני, ואני לא ארע לך ולא לבניך, וגם בניך ובני יעמדו בברית הזה. והמצבה תקרא את שמה מצפה, למה כן, יצף ה' ביני וביניך, שלא תרע לבנותי ולבניהן, הה\"ד והמצפה אשר אמר וגו' אם תענה. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Lavan said to [Jacob] there are two things here: a מצבה and a גל. Just as they are two things, I want them to correspond to two testimonies. The גל corresponds to you not harming me and my sons, and to me not harming you and your children, and so too our descendants. The מצבה is called מצפה (looking) since God should watch you and make sure you do not harm my daughters and their descendants. As Scripture says (31:49-50): And the מצפה...That you should not harass daughters.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samuel_David_Luzzatto\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Shadal</a> (commentary to 31:46) suggests that the מצבה was more of a Hebrew custom (cf. Genesis 28:18 and Joshua 24), while the Aramaean custom was to erect a גל. Therefore, Ya'akov built the former while Lavan's brothers built the latter (this depends on whom לאחיו in verse 46 refers to). He notes that in 31:52, Lavan describes both monuments, but indicates that it is the גל that he will not violate אם אני לא אעבור אליך את הגל הזה). Assuming that he is right that Hebres erected single stone monuments, while Arameans erected many, he suggests that perhaps both kinds of monuments corresponded to their deities; a single stone to the Hebrews' single deity, and multiple stones to the Arameans many deities.</p>\n\n<p>It should be noted that although <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abraham_ben_Moses_ben_Maimon\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rabbenu Avraham ben HaRambam</a> (there) considers the reading of the גל and מצבה as two structures, he also suggests that they could be a single structure, or parts of a single structure.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>This is not a complete answer, but here's a little something about the matzevah: <a href=\"https://wikivisually.com/wiki/Matzevah\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://wikivisually.com/wiki/Matzevah</a></p>\n\n<p>In the Israel Museum in Yerushalayim, there are some matzevot on display. We were told that they represented the Diety in some way, and accompanied private altars. </p>\n\n<p>Both the matzevah and the gal symbolized \"covenants\".</p>\n\n<p>I appreciated your question. Fascinating!</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>Rabeinu bechayei (aka bachyeh) writes:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>רבינו בחיי בראשית פרשת ויצא פרק לא פסוק מו\n  והנה יעקב הרים אבן למצבה וצוה לאחי לבן שילקטו אבנים כמותו שיהיו מצבות, ולא\n   אמר: שיעשו גל, אבל הם לקטו אבנים ויעשו גל, והיתה כונתם כלפי אמונתם ועבודתם שהיו עובדים החמה</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Meaning, yaakov wanted lavan to do exactly as he did; to set up a matzeiva. also he asked that all the men present do so as well. instead, the men put the stones together and created a heap, in consistency with their philosophy. He then goes on to explain how a heap fits with their philosophy.</p>\n\n<p>This answers your question, because it seems there was one goal, for each person involved to set up a monument of his commitment to the covenant they were making.</p>\n\n\n",

And if our Torah would say \"Drink but don't become intoxicated,\" it would not work because there is no precise amount. Therefore he taught in the true Torah that it is permitted...but indicated that drunkenness is repulsive and practically forbidden (Hamaspik L'ovdey Hashem ed.

His example, is drunkenness:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>כבר קדם לנו כי הדברים שירחיקם השכל יספיק לתורה במניעתם בדרך ספור. וכשם שלא אסרה התורה השכרות בפירוש והספיק לה ברמזים בספורים </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Unlike Rabbenu Avraham and Rashba, he is only addressing drunkenness; not any consumption of alcohol. Furthermore, unlike them, he does not say why the Torah chooses to teach intuitive moral instructions through stories rather than direct directives.</p>\n\n<p>For an example of such instruction, see <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Kimhi\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Radak</a> to Genesis (9:20) who writes that the story of Noah's drunkenness is God's way of teaching Man not to get drunk:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>היה הספור הזה להזהיר על משתה היין ושלא לשגות בו...בא ספור ממנו בתורה לספר בגנותו </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p><em>@mevakesh's answer is great, I only want to widen the question a bit and answer from a different point</em>. </p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>I wonder you didn't mention Nazir, that brings the Sin Offering (חטאת) at the end of his Nazirut, to symbolize that his avoiding of the \"worldly pleasures\", including wine, is a kind of a sin.</li>\n<li>In general, after the original sin, part of our commandments (and therefore our goal in this world) focus on intentional \"consuming of the bad\" with the sole intention to turn it into good, by using it in serving Hashem.

See Rav Eliezer Melamed's answer in Peninei Halacha \n<a href=\"http://ph.yhb.org.il/en/03-10-05/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">http://ph.yhb.org.il/en/03-10-05/</a> (partially quoted below):</p>\n\n<p>\"Birkot HaTorah recited in the morning cover all of one’s learning throughout that day, and any work or business conducted in the interim is not considered to be an interruption (Shulchan Aruch 47:10).[6]</p>\n\n<p>[6]The Rishonim disagree concerning the question of whether it is an obligation to learn a few verses of Torah immediately upon reciting Birkot HaTorah. According to Ri, one of the Ba’alei HaTosafot (Berachot 11b, “Shekvar”), Birkot HaTorah differ from the other Birkot HaMitzvot in that they are not directed only towards the present learning, rather they are designated for Torah learning throughout the entire day. Therefore, there is no obligation to learn specifically after the berachah, rather the obligation is to learn something during the day. That is how the Beit Yosef interprets the opinions of the Rosh and the Tur as well. However, the Rambam maintains that the law concerning Birkot HaTorah is like all Birkot HaMitzvot, in which it is necessary to adjoin the berachah to the mitzvah and therefore one must learn immediately following its recital. If he does not learn immediately, the berachah becomes nullified. This case is similar to a person who wants to eat cake and recites, “Borei minei mezonot”, yet does not eat right away, and instead goes to do other things. When he finally wants to eat from the cake, he will need to go back and repeat the Mezonot blessing. Even though it seems from the Shulchan Aruch that the ruling is according to Ri, nonetheless, in the opinion of many Acharonim we follow the Rambam (Mishnah Berurah 47:19), for the Rama in Darkei Moshe explains the opinions of the Rosh and the Tur like the Rambam. Nowadays, the prevalent minhag among all Jews is to recite the three verses of Birkat Kohanim after Birkot HaTorah and that is considered learning after the berachah. After that, many add other rabbinic words such as “Eilu devarim…”, for they contain words of Mishnah and Beraita, (which are considered words of Gemara), and in that way every Jew merits learning Scripture, Mishnah, and Gemara daily.\"</p>\n\n\n",

Where is it first attested?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 16)\n\n<p>A number of Rishonim quote from Makkot but call it Sanhedrin, implying they considered them to be one tractate. See Ramban to Devarim 21:13 and Rashba to Kiddushin 22a who refer to what we have in the Yerushalmi of the second chapter of Makkot as \"פרק בתרא דסנהדרין.\" Also check out Ralbag to Shemot 21 (Shoresh 4 and 16) who calls our second chapter of Makkot \"פרק יג דסנהדרין\". (Ralbag also counts them as a single Masechta called Sanhedrin in his <a href=\"http://mg.alhatorah.org/Full/Bereshit/0.1#e0n7\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">introduction to his Peirush on Chumash</a>.)</p>\n\n<p>These are both technically later than the Rambam cited in user6591's answer, but just to add a possibly earlier source, the Midrash Rabbah (Shir HaShirim 6:8 and Bamidbar 18:17) notes that there are 60 tractates [of Mishna], while we have 61 (counting the three \"Bava\" tractates as one). The Rashash to Bamidbar Rabbah there suggests that this could indicate that Makkot was a part of Sanhedrin at that time. Not an ironclad proof of course, but still worth mentioning.</p>\n\n<p>The Rambam is correct though that there is early manuscript evidence for the joint presentation. The famous Kaufmann manuscript of the Mishna presents Makkot as <a href=\"http://kaufmann.mtak.hu/en/ms50/ms50-153r.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">chapters 12</a>-14 of Sanhedrin. Consider too the incomplete Geonic commentary from the Cairo Geniza (Ginzei Shechter 2 pg 395) which actually combines the chapter אלו הן הנחנקים with כיצד העידם into one long chapter. It's not entirely clear why the Rambam so opposed the notion that they were originally one tractate given all the evidence, the similar topic and style, and the unusual length.</p>\n\n<p>To be fair the Bavli (Shevuot 2b) asks explicitly:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>מכדי תנא ממכות סליק מאי שנא דתני שבועות<br>\n  The teacher just finished Makkot, why is he now teaching Shevuot? (my translation)</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>but a) that is probably a late addition to the text by the Savoraim, and b) it could just mean he finished the topic of \"lashes\" from the last chapter of Makkot, not that he finished a work with the title \"Makkot\".</p>\n\n\n### ✅ Antwort 2 (Score: 9)\n\n<p>Rambam seen <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Rambam_Introduction_to_the_Mishnah.15.52?with=all&lang=bi\" rel=\"noreferrer\">here</a> in his introduction to his pirush on mishnayos seems to be the first who mentions an opinion like this. Rambam himself however disagreed with this.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>אבל מסכת מכות היא נקשרת בנוסתאות עם מסכת סנהדרין ובכללה היא מנויה ואמרו שבשביל שאמר ואלו הן הנחנקין הדביק אליו ואלו הן הלוקין ואין זה טעם אמת אבל היא מסכת בפני עצמה ונסמכה לסנהדרין מפני שאין רשות לבני אדם לענוש ולהלקות אלא השופטים בעצמם כמו שאמר הכתוב (דברים כה) והפילו השופט והכהו לפניו כדי רשעתו.</p>\n<p>Indeed, Tractate Makkot is connected to Tractate Sanhedrin in some textual variants, and it is counted as part of it. And they said that because he said, \"These are the ones strangulated\" [near the end of Sanhedrin], he attached to it, \"These are the ones lashed\" [at the beginning of Makkot]; but this is not a true reason. [Rather], it is a tractate on its own. And it was made adjacent to Sanhedrin because the only people that have permission to punish and lash are the judges themselves, as Scripture stated (Deuteronomy 25:2), \"the judge shall put him down and give him lashes in his presence, by count, according to his evil.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>These words of Rambam are brought by Tosafos Yom Tov in his introductory remarks to maseches Makos.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>In an anonymous liturgical poem (<a href=\"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Azharot\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Azharot</a>) titled \"אזהרת ראשית לעמך נתת\", predating Maimonides and <a href=\"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kaufmann_Manuscript\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">MS Kaufmann</a>*, the author points to \"... six orders of Mishnah, upon which is <em>thirty-six tractates of</em> [Babylonian] <em>Talmud</em>\".

They both require removal [from one's home], while Rabbi Shimon exempts.  Any amount of them [when mixed with normal food] is prohibited to eaten in Jerusalem.  Any growth that comes from them may not be eaten in Jerusalem, neither by a non-Kohen, nor an animal, while Rabbi Shimon permits.  All of the above is for Ma’aser and Bikkurim, but not for Terumah.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The Bartenura on R’ Shimon’s lenient rulings on Onen and removal limits it to Bikkurim. By Ma’aser, everyone agrees that the verses in the section of Vidui Ma’aser apply, including לא אכלתי באני - “I did not eat it as an Onen” - and the preceding several verses regarding destroying said Ma’aser. However, Bikkurim is called Terumah, and therefore, just as Terumah is exempt from these laws, so, too, Bikkurim. </p>\n\n<p>TLDR: According to everyone, Terumah is exempt from the laws of Onen and destruction, learned out from the verses in Vidui Ma’aser. </p>\n\n<p>Now compare to Ma’aser Sheini 5:10:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>בַּמִּנְחָה בְיוֹם טוֹב הָאַחֲרוֹן הָיוּ מִתְוַדִּין. כֵּיצַד הָיָה הַוִּדּוּי, בִּעַרְתִּי הַקֹּדֶשׁ מִן הַבַּיִת (דברים כו), זֶה מַעֲשֵׂר שֵׁנִי וְנֶטַע רְבָעִי. נְתַתִּיו לַלֵּוִי, זֶה מַעְשַׂר לֵוִי. וְגַם נְתַתִּיו, <strong>זוֹ תְּרוּמָה וּתְרוּמַת מַעֲשֵׂר</strong>. לַגֵּר לַיָּתוֹם וְלָאַלְמָנָה, זֶה מַעֲשַׂר עָנִי, הַלֶּקֶט וְהַשִּׁכְחָה וְהַפֵּאָה, אַף עַל פִּי שֶׁאֵינָן מְעַכְּבִין אֶת הַוִּדּוּי. מִן הַבַּיִת, זוֹ חַלָּה: </p>\n  \n  <p>‎By the afternoon of the last festival day, they would make the declaration. How was the declaration made? \"I have removed the Kodesh [consecrated material] from the house\" (Deuteronomy 26:13)--this is Ma'aser Sheni and Neta Revai. \"Have given them unto the Levite\"--this is Ma'aser Levi [The first tithe of produce, which must be given to the Levi]. \"And also I have given it\"--<strong>this is Terumah and Terumat Ma'aser.</strong> \"And also to the stranger, to the orphan, and to the widow\"--this is the poor man's tithe, Leket [fallen gleanings given to the poor], Shikhecha [forgotten gleanings given to the poor], and Pe'ah [corner of a field given to the poor], even though these do not invalidate the confession [if they have not been given]. \"From the house\"--this is Challah [dough that must be set aside for the priest].</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Emphasis is mine. </p>\n\n<p>If Terumah is included in Vidui Ma’aser, it stands to reason that the laws of Onen and destruction, learned from said passage, should apply to Terumah as well, and if so, Bikkurim should also be included. </p>\n\n<p>Are we forced to say that there is a machlokes Tannaim, and according to the Tanna in Ma’aser Sheini, Terumah is indeed included in those laws? If so, how do the Tannaim in Bikkurim learn the passuk expounded in Ma’aser Sheini to include Terumah?</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p><sup>All quotes come from Sefaria.</sup></p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>My understanding is that the mention of teruma in the vidduy is to fully list the different things that had to be given. The mishna in Bikkurim says that ma'aser and bikkurim both require vidduy, whereas teruma doesn't require vidduy. The Bartenura comments on this mishna that although teruma is mentioned as part of the vidduy in the words וְגַם נְתַתִּיו, someone who gives only teruma and not ma'aser and bikkurim wouldn't say the vidduy. The legal difference is only that you can't say the vidduy if you didn't bring each of those things (though the mishna in Ma'aser Sheni itself notes that there are exceptions even to this), but not to include everything listed under the same laws.</p>\n\n<p>This is similar to the way that when a sota is required to swear that she didn't have relations with <em>this man</em>, she also has to swear about <em>any other man</em> (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Mishnah_Sotah.2.5\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Sota 2:5</a>). This doesn't mean the laws are the same between the case of <em>this man</em> and <em>any other man</em> (because only <em>this man</em> could have triggered the sota process), but once she is obligated to make the statement, the Torah requires her to include any other man as part of it. I think that the same is true in this case: the Torah requires someone who says the vidduy to declare that he disposed of his teruma and other tithes correctly, without necessarily implying that the rules of all the cases mentioned are the same.</p>\n\n\n",

Especially with verse 3 which says: </p>\n\n<p>\"The Voice of Hashem is upon the waters, THE G-D OF GLORY THUNDERS; Hashem is over the vast waters.\"</p>\n\n<p>Baal-Hadad was the son of the chief god El and he was also a weather, rain, storm and thunder god whose cult originated in Mesopotamia (originally called \"Ishkur\" in Sumer and \"Haddad\" in Akkad).

Is there a preference to call a Levi over a Gadol?</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>As @JNF pointed out in his fine answer, calling a Levi when there is no Kohein does not seem to be correct according to what we find in the Poskim.</p>\n\n<p>But as the OP has pointed out, the minhag to call a Levi in that case is widespread, and apparently some have approved of the practice. That being the case, perhaps we can find some justification for calling a Levi:</p>\n\n<p>For K'HT there is a takana \"<strong>מפני דרכי שלום</strong>\" to go in order: Kohein, Levi, Yisroel, so there should not be an argument about who deserves the first <strong>עליה</strong> - we follow a special order that no-one can argue with. </p>\n\n<p>If so, it's more logical to go with Levi next if there is no Kohein - again for darchei shalom, so there should not be an argument about who deserves the first <strong>עליה</strong>. The case of a Levi but no Kohein is a bit of an 'edge case'- so minhag can prevail there. The minhag to give it to a Levi makes a great deal of sense and seems more in the spirit of the original, explicit takana. </p>\n\n<p><em>To take it a step further, there is a <strong>סברה</strong> to uphold this minhag:<br/><br/>\nWhy should the whole takana collapse because there is no Kohein? Calling a Levi first still maintains darchei shalom.</em></p>\n\n<p>Unless we can find a גמרא that states explicitly otherwise - that we should <strong>not</strong> call a Levi - it seems far-fetched to demand that a shul change its standing minhag simply because the poskim favor a different minhag, when the shul's minhag is entirely logical and reflects the spirit of the halacha. </p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>One problem with this סברה might be that we are always concerned that someone who is not a Kohein could be confused for a Kohein if they are called first. Therefore we always say \"<strong>ישראל במקום כהן</strong>\" when a Yisroel is called instead of a Kohein.  </p>\n\n<p>We would certainly have to say \"<strong>לוי במקום כהן</strong>\" if we called a Levi, but perhaps that's not enough: Since people know that a Levi is special, they may confuse the Levi for a Kohein regardless. </p>\n\n<p>A greater problem with this idea might be that although the reason stated for giving a Kohein the first <strong>עליה</strong> is because of that takana, the fundamental reason for choosing a Kohein over someone else reverts back to \"<strong>וקידשתו</strong>\" - from which Chazal learned that a Kohein should always be honored by putting him first. However  \"<strong>וקידשתו</strong>\" does not apply to a Levi, and applying it to a Levi might actually be considered insulting to Kohanim in general.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p><em><blockquote> All told, I tend to agree that calling a Levi first when there is no Kohein is not a correct minhag:<br/> It could cause confusion about who is a Kohein and could even be an affront to the Kohanim in general.<br/><br>\nChazal told us to honor the Kohanim. When there is no Kohein, everyone is equal in that respect, and so we call the <strong>תלמוד חכם</strong>.<br>\n</blockquote></em></p>\n\n\n",

When Lot was not righteous (as in 13:1), and went with Avraham, עמו 'imo' is used, to indicate that he was with him, but not similar to him, but rather secondary to him. See also HaKtav v'HaKabala to Genesis (24:32).</p>\n\n<p>He uses the same approach to explain the episode of Balak, but seems to reverse himself on the definitions of 'ito' and 'imo' respectively. First God tells Bil'am not to go with Balak's men (Numbers 22:12). However, later God tells him the opposite; to join Balak's men (22:20). HaKtav V'HaKabbalah (22:12) explains this based on the aforementioned distinction between עמו (imo) and אתו (ito).  'Imo' is used when two things together are similar; not merely juxtaposed. 'Ito' is used for things that find themselves together but are not themselves similar. When God told Bil'am not to go with them he said לֹ֥א תֵלֵ֖ךְ עִמָּהֶ֑ם, using the root עמו. This meant that he shouldn't go together with them, united in purpose to curse the Jews. However, when God told him to go he said  ק֖וּם לֵ֣ךְ אִתָּ֑ם using the root אתו. This meant that he should merely go with them; but not join them in going for the purpose of cursing the Jews.</p>\n\n<p>In several places, however, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malbim\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Malbim</a> writes the exact opposite (e.g. Genesis 24:54, Exod. 21:3): that עמו indicates that the two things are similar, while אתו indicates something secondary to something else.</p>\n\n<p>Malbim explains (commentary to 12:4) that (12:4) uses אתו since Lot was not similar to Avraham. Avraham was purposefully traveling away from his homeland as commanded by God. Lot was just tagging along. He explains that (13:1) uses עמו since in that case he and Avraham were equals; they were going with each other, as opposed to one tagging along. This was because Lot was also rich and was therefore independent.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p><a href=\"http://thejewishstar.com/stories/Parshat-Balak-Relationships-with-with,2539\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">This might help to answer your question</a></p>\n\n<p>In addressing this question, the Netziv shares his own observations about the differences between going “et” versus going “im.” Following on his coattails, perhaps in the specific context of people traveling together, this distinction applies. Those who go “et” others, are walking on the same path, but their minds are in different places. Those who walk “im” others, not only share a physical space but also share a mental and perhaps spiritual state of being.</p>\n\n<p>People who go “et” others (different mindsets) in the Torah include: Terach with his family on the way to Haran; Lot going with Avram on his continued journey to Canaan; Lot immediately before the fight that caused him to separate from Avraham; Avraham with his lads to sacrifice his son. Avimelekh and company, as they depart from Yitzchak after making a treaty; Yaakov and his sons when they went to Egypt, all with different hopes for the future; the Egyptians who came with Yosef to bury Yaakov.</p>\n\n<p>People who go “im” others (same mindset) in the Torah include: Lot going with Avram after the events in Egypt (after seeing G-d help Avram in a tight situation) [soon after, Lot separates “me’imo” to move to S’dom]; Avraham accompanying the angels on their way to destroy S’dom; Lot and his daughters escaping from S’dom; Eliezer and the servants looking to find a wife for Yitzchak; Rivka’s choice to go with Eliezer to be Yitzchak’s wife; Yaakov with Lavan (until he is no longer “imo” (Bereishit  31:2); 400 men with Eisav; the brothers of Yosef when they go to bury their father.</p>\n\n<p>It is interesting to note that like Bilaam, Lot is the main figure who jumps back and forth. Perhaps this is because, like Bilaam, he was an opportunist who came close when it was good for him, but distanced himself when things did not work out.</p>\n\n<p>P.s. The difference was once described to me as 'beside him' and 'with him' for 'with him' indicates equality, while 'beside him' will tell us that one is the principal.</p>\n\n<p>In Hebrew, 'ito’ has its word root as 'et’. 'The word 'et’ is used to precede a subject in order to give emphasis to the subject. In its very essence, then, 'et’is subordinate. When Lot was originally with Abram he knew his role. Abram was the wise, talented, teacher and leader. Lot was the faithful, trusted, and able student. In order to succeed in virtually anything, one has to know his talents and limitations. Imagine an offensive lineman in football who thinks he is the quarterback. Or imagine a gifted auto technician who thinks he is the CEO. Such people will not only fail in their dream positions, they will also fail in the jobs in which they are truly talented.\nLot went from a proper perspective of 'Ito’ –first Abram which means subordination – to a disastrous one of 'Imo’. 'Imo’ means I am with you as an equal. When Lot returned from Egypt laden with wealth and resources, he became ’Imo’-in this verse Lot is written before the word ’Imo’. He no longer viewed himself as subordinate to Abram.</p>\n\n\n",

Moshe Frank from Yerushalaim  (I heard it from his talmid) explained that one can understand the story only by realizing that Lavan was able to fully separate Yaakov, Rachel, and Leah in the discussions regarding marriage. In other words, Yaakov did not speak with Rachel directly about marying her, but with Lavan only. Afterwards, Lavan went to Rachel and Leah and stated that he found a great <em>shiduch</em> for Leah. Yaakov sent the gifts to Rachel, which she would give to Leah based on words of her father Lavan. Rachel was afrad to hurt her sister and resolve the matter with Yaakov directly.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>I don't know the Ari Zal (please post sources). But when Esav failed and faded, it became necessary to marry Leah to Yaakov, to build Shivtei Yisrael. Lavan had the wrong intentions but it needed to happen, and Yaakov would surely not have cooperated.<br />\nAccording to the Midrash, Leah desperately wanted to marry Yaakov (instead of Esav), crying and praying till her eyes got messed up. She was <em>able</em> to marry Yaakov because of her father's plan, and because Yaakov himself had given her an opening by what he had himself done to fool his own father, according to that same Midrash (see <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/127034/do-commentaries-address-question-the-morality-of-leah-and-rachels-actions-again\">https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/127034</a>).<br />\nI think all of this is a consequence of the situation. It seems unreasonable to treat that as \"taking sides\". Perhaps it was inevitable once Yaakov had fooled his father.<br />\nTo me it sounds like asking, Wouldn't things have been much better if Avraham Avinu had not said, \"במה אדע כי אירשנה\"? - We wouldn't have had to go down to Mitzrayim...! Our Avos were incredibly holy people, but not yet perfect. Fixing their almost invisible imperfections is part of the path that we have followed ever since.</p>\n\n\n",

Couldn't each of these people have resolved their differences via negotiating or some other means?

These events are consistent with the dictum: אם ללצים הוא יליץ, ולענוים יתן חן (Mishlei 3, 34).\nThere is a place for deception, it is only wrong when used wrongfully. As we must surely assume that all these episodes that you mention are justifiable, the deception itself is a non-issue.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>I would challenge your hypotheses, as stated in the question: \"Why does the Torah seem to tolerate cheating\".</p>\n\n<p>We see that all the cheaters were punished eventually for their cheating.</p>\n\n<p>To analyze a few that you mention:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Ya'akov apparently takes advantage of a tired Esav by having him sell the birthright so that he can eat some food. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>This example of yours is not a good one.</p>\n\n<p>Yaakov does not take advantage of a tired Esav, but rather provides him with bread - that he didn't ask for.

And, he prays to G-d for help. One thing that doesn't seem apparent, is that assuming that Ya'akov knew that he was outnumbered, and that he was afraid of his brother, why didn't he run away, try to outmaneuver his brother or hide in a cave for a while until he calculated that Esav would eventually give up searching for him?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>Because Ya'akov was not alone.</p>\n\n<p>The people with him included 13 children, 2 wives, 2 concubines, servants of his own, and servants for his wives and concubines.</p>\n\n<p>He also had huge amounts of cattle and sheep, and many tents and other posessions.</p>\n\n<p>See verse 32:6 \"I have acquired cattle, asses, sheep, male and female slaves\"</p>\n\n<p>His camp was so large that he was able to divide it into 2 and credibly represent that one of them was the whole camp, so that the other might escape.</p>\n\n<p>There is no way to \"hide\" such a camp, and it would be the worst sort of cowardice to abandon it to Eisav.

Targ. pseudo-Jonathan to Num. xxii. 5). </p>\n\n<p>R. Joshua b. Levi, however, identifies Laban with Kemuel (Gen. xxii. 21), the latter name being interpreted as, \"who stood up against God's people\"</p>\n\n<p>Laban is called also \"the master of impostors\" (ib. lxxv. 6). When he saw the bracelets on Rebekah's arms (Gen. xxiv. 30) he determined to kill Eliezer; but the latter, divining his intention, pronounced the Sacred Name, by which he caused camels to remain suspended in the air above the well. This and Eliezer's resemblance to Abraham made Laban believe that Eliezer was Abraham. Laban therefore invited him to enter the house (Midr. Abkir, in Yalḳ., Gen. 109; comp. Midr. Hagadah on Gen. xxiv. 23).</p>\n\n<p>When Jacob had completed his seven years of service, Laban assembled his countrymen and consulted them as to the best means to retain him; \"for,\" said he, \"ye know that formerly we had a scarcity of water, and it is only through this righteous man that we are now blessed with an abundance of it.\" His countrymen advised him to substitute Leah for Rachel (Targ. pseudo-Jonathan and Yerushalmi to Gen. xxix. 22; Gen. R. lxx. 17).</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.chabad.org/parshah/article_cdo/aid/1690855/jewish/Laban-the-Anti-Semite.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Shows how Laban tricked Jacob into slavery and Jacob finding his way out.</a></p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>1.Answer by rabeinu Bachya.

Rivka told Yaakov to stay in Haran \"yamim ahadim\". YAMIM is 1 year (based on parasha BEHAR \"yamim tehe geulato\") and AHADIM are SHABATOT (based on Midrash where Shabbat is called \"yahid\"), so basically Rivka told Yaakov to stay with Lavan 1 year of Shabbatot, i.e. 52 into 7 = 364 shabbatot and this is 7 years!</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: -2)\n\n<p>First, is your question about 7 years as opposed to 6 or in general, why so many years? Because I asked something similar - why not use his father's wealth to get away from the work altogether and nobody responded yet. </p>\n\n<p>I don't know a clear answer, but I can only hint you, <em>based on Baash\"t and Ariz\"l explanations on Yaakov's mission at Lavan</em>. If you remember, he stole Eisov's Brochos, and therefore, Eisov's mission in this world. His original mission was a  Torah learner (Aseh Tov) but now he needed to be Ish Tzayd, to complete Eisov's mission of Sur meRah. This is the reason he went away to Lavan to Huzt laHaretz, the land of idolatry, instead of his father's bringing Rochel home to the Holy Land.</p>\n\n<p>This is the reason he spent those long years at Lavan's residence Mamash as Lavan insisted, constantly fighting Lavan (Sur meRah) and going through all those tests and humiliations etc, instead of grabbing the grown-up daughters and running away back home.</p>\n\n<p>I am sorry I'm really bad with sources, I simply don't remember who said that, and don't have time to search it up (source needed) but Eisov was one to father and establish the 12 Tribes, but now Yaakov took it all. Isn't it strange he realized he should have children at 84?</p>\n\n<p>So the answer (according to Drush) is that that was his new mission he took from Eisov to cope with Lavan's evil 3 times 7 years, you probably know what those numbers stand for.</p>\n\n<p>Sorry again for not bringing sources.</p>\n\n\n",

It is a contraction of two words מה ידוע - \"What is known?\" or \"For what cause?\" </p>\n\n<p>למה has a wider use as it appears in Biblical as well as in rabbinic Hebrew, and is the more common modern Hebrew \"colloquial\" word. While it can be used to ask about the cause, it is more commonly used to inquire about the purpose of something. it essentially means \"for what\" as מה means \"what\".</p>\n\n<p>So, applying this to the above two verses, (my own application):</p>\n\n<p>In the first, the guards see that the same inventory of bricks is not being produced as had been produced before. So, they ask מדוע - what's the reason for the shortage. Some event has happened, what's the reason for it?</p>\n\n<p>In verse 15, people ask Pharoah למה - what's the reason for your treating us this way?</p>\n\n<p>There is a subtle nuance with these two verses, and, I suppose that מדוע  could be used in the 2nd verse. Offhand, it seems that מדוע refers to past events, while למה refers to present or ongoing / continuing events or items.</p>\n\n<p>Read the rest of the article regarding the use of למה in Shemot 32:11. The author seems to confirm my thinking, that למה is a question about the future.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>The translation of מדוע is why. The root is מדע which can be translated as   the noun: knowledge, teaching or reason like is found in the Jastrow dictionary.</p>\n\n<p>The usage of למה depends on context. It is a contraction of לשם מה (on account of what). It can also appear in midrash as למה הדבר דומה (to what is the thing similar) like in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Kohelet_Rabbah.7.13.1/he/Midrash_Rabbah_--_TE?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Kohelet Rabbah 7:13:1</a>.</p>\n\n<p>So למה has more of a connotation of comparison, while מדוע is aimed at the general knowledge or reasoning about something.</p>\n\n\n",

Hope to God, for I will yet thank Him for the salvations of my countenance and my God.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>(Translation from <a href=\"http://www.chabad.org/library/bible_cdo/aid/16263/jewish/Chapter-42.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Chabad.org</a>)</p>\n<p>My question is not why the two verses are  nearly identical save the last three words. I read in the <a href=\"http://www.artscroll.com/Books/9781578195558.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">ArtScroll Tehillim</a> why this is so:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>יְשׁוּעֹת פָּנַי - <em>For the salvations of my coutenance.</em> [A poetic play on words of v.6 and the first word of v.7.] In v.6, we praised God <em>for the salvations of His coutanence</em>, the furthering of His purpose even when they appear to conflict with our own aspirations. Here we proclaim our realization that His purposes are in fact the <em>salvations of my coutanence</em> the truest fulfillment of our own aspiration (<em>R' Hirsch</em>)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This is not my question. For some reason, the phrase \"salvations of my countenance\" just doesn't seem to make sense, although for sure that is the literal translation of the words. L'havdil, Christian translations translated the words as \"my Savior and my God\" but I suspect this is only to push their agenda that Yeshu is God, chas v'shalom.</p>\n<p>How should I understand what \"salvations of my countenance\" to mean? Perhaps it really is just a fancy way of saying savior but Jewish translations are wary to translate it this way because it would look like it was supporting Christian doctrine? All Jewish translations I have seen translate the words the way I mentioned before, \"the salvations of my countenance\".</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>The <em>Daat Miqra</em> commentary gives several ways to understand this phrase in context. One of them (the vocative: \"My salvation and my God\") is indeed what you say you've read in Christian translations.</p>\n<p>On verse 6, it says (my translation):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>‮ישועות פניו: ישועות באות מאת פניו (של אלהים), והוא משפט בפני עצמו אמור בלשון קריאה בסיום דברי הנחמה<sup>*</sup>. פרוש אחר: אודנו על הישועות הבאות מאת פניו, ועוד אפשר לפרש: עוד אבוא לפניו ואודה לו על ישועותיו. ועל כל פנים ׳פניו׳ רומזת ל׳פני אלהים׳ שבפסוק ג...</p>\n<p>ישועות פניו: Salvations (ישועות) come from his presence (of God), and this phrase stands alone, as a vocative, at the conclusion of the words of comfort<sup>*</sup>. Another explanation: \"I will thank him for the salvations that come from his presence\", and it is also possible to explain: \"I will come again before him and thank him for his salvations. In any case, \"his presence\" (פניו) refers to \"God's presence\" (פני אלהים) in verse 3...</p>\n<p>‮<sup>*</sup> כן מסתבר לפרש על פי בעלי הטעמים, שעשו הפסק גדול בתבת ׳אודנו׳, וחברו את הדיבור ׳כי עוד אודנו׳ אל הדיבור הקודם לו: הוחילי לאלהים.</p>\n<p><sup>*</sup> And it seems that such is the explanation of the cantillators, who put a large pause on the word \"I will thank him\" (אודנו), and joined the phrase \"I will further thank him\" (כי עוד אודנו) to the preceding phrase: \"hope to God\" (הוחילי לאלהים).</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Similarly, on verse 12, the commentary has (my translation):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>‮ישועת פני ואלהי: בקריאה: אתה הנותן לפני (פנים ממש) ישועות. ואתה הוא אלהי! ׳ישועת פני׳ משמע ישועתי. כדרך המליצה הנוקטת את החלק תמורת הכל, הפנים תמורת האדם כלו. יאפשר שנקט ׳ישועת פני׳ על שם ששמחת הישועה נכרת בפניו של אדם. פרוש אחר: האלהים ההולך לפני להושיעני. ואפשר שכל הדיבור ׳ישועת פני ואלהי׳ נמשך אחר ׳אודנו׳: אודנו על שהוא ישועות פני ואלהי, או: אודנו ואמר לו, כי הוא ישועות פני ואלהי.</p>\n<p>ישועת פני ואלהי: in vocative: \"you are the one who puts salvations before me (\"my face\", literally). And you are my God!\" The meaning of \"the salvations of my countenance\" (ישועת פני) is \"my salvation\". Like the poetic way a part is used to denote the whole, here \"face/countenance\" means the entire person. And perhaps the phrase \"salvations of my countenance\" (ישועת פני) was chosen because the joy of salvation is visible on a person's face. Another explanation: \"The God that goes before me to save me\". And it is possible that the entire phrase \"salvations of my countenance and my God\" (ישועת פני ואלהי) follow the word \"I will thank him\" (אודנו): \"I will thank him because he is my salvation and my God\", or: \"I will thank him and say to him that he is my salvation and my God\".</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: -1)\n\n<p>An alternative, drush-style translation of \"הוחילי לאלהים כי עוד אודנו ישועות פניו\" is that <em>I trust in G-d that we will again acknowledge the turning of (or paying heed of) His countenance.</em> (to us) And this is accomplished by our returning (<em>turning</em>) to G-d.</p>\n\n<p>This follows the meaning of ישע as found in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Genesis.4.4?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Bereshit 4:4</a> which says:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>וְהֶ֨בֶל הֵבִ֥יא גַם־ה֛וּא מִבְּכֹר֥וֹת צֹאנ֖וֹ וּמֵֽחֶלְבֵהֶ֑ן <strong>וַיִּ֣שַׁע</strong> יְהוָ֔ה אֶל־הֶ֖בֶל וְאֶל־מִנְחָתֽוֹ׃</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>This follows Rashi's understanding that ישע, from the root שעה is a synonym for ויפן, to turn.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><strong>וישע</strong> וַיִּפֶן, וְכֵן וְאֶל מִנְחָתוֹ <strong>לֹא שָׁעָה</strong>-לֹא פָנָה, וְכֵן וְלֹא <strong>יִשְׁעֶה</strong> (ישעיהו י\"ז)-לֹא יִפְנֶה, וְכֵן <strong>שְׁעֵה</strong> מֵעָלָיו (איוב י\"ד) פְּנֵה מֵעָלָיו:</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The Targum to Bereshit 4:4 also translates וישע as <em>desire</em>. That we become favorable again in G-d's eyes.</p>\n\n<p>The introductory words to this chapter of Tehillim explain that it is intended to arouse the hearts of those Jews who are unable to feel or appreciate the great loss of having been exiled from their Father's table. It tries to inform those individuals of the benefits of G-d's service and promises that G-d will extend His mercies to us from now and forever.</p>\n\n<p>And so, the plural aspect of ישועות implies a dual aspect to this turning. That through our turning below, this precipitates G-d's turning above. <strong>אתערותא דלתתא לאתערותא דלעילא</strong> And this return to G-d brings about salvation. (ישועות from the root ישע meaning to save or to deliver)</p>\n\n<p>And this idea is also expressed in Kedushat Levi to Shemot 15:1 which says:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>והנה <strong>בקריעת ים סוף היה אתערותא דלתתא שישראל הטיבו מעשיהם וגרמו במעשיהם רחמי השם יתברך עליהם מחמת גודל האמונה והבטחון שהיה להם בה' שיעשה להם תשועה</strong> שמשום <strong>הכי עלה בלבם לומר שירה קודם התשועה</strong> כנ\"ל. וזה נכון כסאך מאז, מאז ישיר, שעל ידי אז ישיר שמרומז שם גודל בטחונם בה'. משום הכי נאמר אז ישיר, שתיבת אז, פירוש באותו זמן קודם הבקיעה אז עלה בדעתם ובטחו בה' שיאמרו שירה וכיון שהיה להם בטחון ודבקות ואמונה בה' <strong>אין לך אתערותא דלתתא גדול מזה שה' צלם שכמו שהם בטחו בה' שיעשה להם נס כן ה' שהוא צלם עשה עמהם נס.</strong> משום הכי באז, בזה שהיה אתערותא דלתתא. נכון כסאך, שכסא נקראים דברים האלה שכמו שאם אתה סמוך ונשען על איזה דבר אותו דבר שנסמך ונשען עליו נקרא כסא שעל כסאו נסמך ונשען היושב עליו כן כביכול <strong>שאם יש אתערותא דלתתא והמדות שלמטה מעוררים למעלה שהשם יתברך יתנהג במדת טובו ובמדת הרחמים ובמדת החסד עם עמו בית ישראל</strong> אזי נקראים המדות דלתתא כסא. ולכן אמרו (בראשית רבה פב) יעקב חקוק מתחת כסא כבודו, שיעקב אבינו היה מעורר במדותיו ובצדקותיו הטובות להיות שהאל יתנהג עמו במדת החסד ובמדת הרחמים וכיון שבתיבת אז, פירושו שבטחונינו בקריעת ים סוף קודם שנבקע הים היינו מובטחים שיקרע הים ונשיר שירה בתופים וכנ\"ל שכל זה פירושו של תיבת אז. וזה הבטחון היה התעוררות מלמטה והכסא למדת שלמעלה שיעשה עמנו האל נס בקריעת ים סוף. <strong>וכיון שהתעוררות דלתתא שעל ידי זה ה' צלנו מתנהג כן עמנו למעלה נקראים התעוררות דלתתא כסא</strong> וכנ\"ל. ולזה נכון כסאך מאז, שתיבת אז אשר ביארנו שבטחונינו היה שיעשה נס זה הבטחון היה כסא לנס:</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Levi Yitzchok of Berditchov connects the idea of our change in action (turning) below to bringing about G-d's change in action from above. That this is associated with our faithfulness and that it brings about salvation. In the case of the splitting of the Red Sea, this was demonstrated through singing (like saying Tehillim).</p>\n\n<p>And all this is emphasized in the closing posuk of the chapter (כִּי־ע֣וֹד אוֹדֶ֑נּוּ יְשׁוּעֹ֥ת פָּ֜נַ֗י וֵֽאלֹהָֽי) which underlines the <em>my</em> turning <strong><em>and</em></strong> the turning of <em>my G-d</em>.</p>\n\n\n",

This explanation of Shadal seems to contradict these common-sense rules; they prevent strangers from causing strife and upsetting the locals.</p>\n<p>My question is:\n<strong>Can a stranger enter a town and decide some local bylaws aren't applicable to him</strong>?</p>\n<p>E.g.: Could a person claim that the laws of <em>alternate parking</em> don't apply to him as a visitor; in his hometown there's no such a thing (or it's on a different day)?</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>לא נוכל</strong>: נ\"ל לא מחסרון כח כי היו שם שלשה עדרי צאן, והוא רחוק שיעשה יעקב לבדו מה שלא יכלו שלשה אנשים, אבל אמרו לא נוכל מפני התנאי שהתנו ביניהם, שלא יהיה רשות לאחד מן העדרים להשתמש ממימי הבאר בהיותו לבדו. והנה יעקב אולי שאל אם נשארו עדרים אחרים לבא ואמרו לו שלא נשאר אלא עדר רחל, וכשראה אותה מהר וגלל את האבן והשקה את צאנה. ואף אם לא שאל אם נשארו עדרים אחרים שלא באו, <strong>הנה הוא לא היה מחוייב לשמור התנאי שהתנו ביניהם</strong>, ומצד אחר דבר הגון עשה (אף אם לא היתה קרובתו) למהר לפטור את רחל, שהיתה נערה אחת בין כמה אנשים.‏</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>I think you may be reading too much into Shadal's words. The key point here, I think, is התנאי שהתנו ביניהם – it was an agreement made between the shepherds. They made a mutually beneficial agreement to not take water without all the shepherds present so that water would not be wasted (as Shadal writes earlier: כדי שלא יאבד אחד מהם את המים שלא לצורך).</p>\n\n<p>This does not appear to have been a law, or even a custom. It was an agreement made between various individuals. Each shepherd essentially said \"I won't take water alone if you don't take water alone\". Yaakov was never party to the agreement so he had no obligation to follow it. The well was apparently not anyone's property, so there was no reason for Yaakov not to use it in whatever way he wanted.</p>\n\n<p>If this is the case, I don't think Shadal's explanation has much bearing on the rules of adhering to local laws and customs.</p>\n\n\n",

He says that Mahari\"l bowed down 3 times when he left his place, and faced the ark while doing that. He repeated this when he was at the entrance of the shul. He then adds that when leaving, one should not have his back to the ark, but should face sideways. One should also face sideways when he leaves the <em>teiva</em> (after being Shat'z or Torah reader.)</p>\n\n<p>I'm inferring from this that one should never have his back to the ark when he leaves, and moreover, he shouldn't even face the ark (other than for bowing), but should face sideways when leaving. So, if the door is either next to the ark or opposite it, one should walk out facing sideways. If the door is to the sides, he can face the doors.</p>\n\n<p>In my shul, the door is to the left when facing the ark. So, exiting the shul, the ark is to my right.

So, he had to be \"punished\" in some way. But, of course, it doesn't directly address why G-d hardens his heart to do this job (showing G-d's might). BTW, look at <a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=9596&st=&pgnum=60&hilite=\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Shemot 5:2</a> where Pharaoh asks who is this \"adon-ai\" that I should listen to him?

Therefore, it is appropriate that he hardens Pharaoh's heart so that he would understand my strength. He states that G-d's method is to bring punishments on the idolatrous nations of the world in order that Israel observe and fear G-d (and not imitate this behavior.)</p>\n\n<p><em>Siftei Chachamim</em> expands on this concept further. He says that G-d says that if I didn't harden his heart and just brought about the plagues, people might think that G-d punishes people who do <em>teshuva</em>. But I (g-d) know that he won't repent with a full heart. Therefore, I have to harden his heart so that others will understand the reason for the plagues that follow. Note that <em>Siftei Chachamim</em> tries to explain Rashi's explanation on G-d's method also because the verse implies that G-d wants to increase the punishments beyond the measure of the actual sin.

The Egyptian superstition was that when being judged after death, a person's heart was weighed against a feather (the feather of Truth IIRC). If the heart was lighter, he was judged innocent. Thus, Pharaoh hardening his own heart can mean that he was guilty <strong>even in terms of his own beliefs</strong>. Hashem hardening his heart can therefore mean that Pharaoh is now punished by those means or that his refusal (in his own terms) to repent causes him to lose the ability to repent, or by moving along the path of error he has that much farther to go to return, ...</p>\n\n<p>Rav Shimshon Rafael Hirsch prefers the idea that Hashem helped strengthen Pharaoh so that he had free will and could make a totally objective decision. He prefers the meaning to be 'strengthen' rather than 'harden'.</p>\n\n<p>Also note @Fred giving the pointers </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Also, for some examples of articles that discuss some of the major\n  views among the rishonim on this, see\n  <a href=\"http://www.shaalvim.org/sfw/shiurim/view.asp?id=643\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a>,\n  <a href=\"http://divreichaim.blogspot.com/2013/01/pharoahs-loss-of-bechira-ramban-lshitaso.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a>,\n  <a href=\"http://doleh-u-mashkeh.blogspot.com/2013/12/bechira-chofshis-2.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a>,\n  and\n  <a href=\"http://www.yutorah.org/lectures/lecture.cfm/730430/Rabbi_David_Horwitz/Parashat__Bo:_Rambam%E2%80%99s_Resolution_of_the_Antinomy_of_Human_Free_Will_and_God%E2%80%99s__Hardening_of_Pharaoh%E2%80%99s_Heart\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

In other words, should we assume that the Torah is meant to be a book for the Jewish people? (Not that we exclude Gentiles from learning the Torah if they wish, but it's main purpose is for Jews.) So, why do Jews need to know the family history of non-Jews such as Yishma'el and Esav?</p>\n\n<p>I can see that at least regarding Esav's lineage, Amalek, might have some Jewish \"significance\" as eventually that nation attacked B'nai Yisra'el.

He includes the listing of the descendants of Noah, the descendants of Seir, the kings of Edom, and the like. He writes that the genealogies are meant to strengthen belief in the Torah's account of creation, starting with one man. This account may be difficult for some to accept given the multiplicity of languages and groups of humans. Particularly, some might doubt that such diversity developed over just a few millennia. The Torah therefore mentions the names of well known characters and their lineage, (and the story of how they got scattered throughout the world, and how their various languages developed), so that the Torah's account of creation; a fundament of Judaism, become more believable.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Kimhi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Radak</a> writes similarly in his commentary to Genesis (5:29, and 9:28) regarding the mention of the decedents of Adam and Noah respectively.</p>\n\n<p>For a discussion of the role of geologies by <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aaron_Demsky\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Prof. Aaron Demsky</a>, a modern scholar, see <a href=\"http://thetorah.com/reading-biblical-genealogies/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a>.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p><em>Forgive my sourcelessness again, that's my \"oral tradition\", that crystallized for decades.

Should I wait until I have better clothes to wear or should I just go as I am now? I am hesitant because it is a holy place and I do not want to disrespect it or its members.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 21)\n\n<p>You are a very responsible and respectful person for inquiring about whether wearing your current clothes would be disrespectful or not to the synagogue. I really have to hand it to you, not everyone is that respectful.</p>\n\n<p>It depends on what day of the week you plan on visiting to the synagogue. If you're planning on visiting during a weekday, then your normal clothes, provided that they aren't indecent, will suffice. There are plenty of Orthodox Jews who, during the week, wear their normal working clothes to the services. If you're planning on going on a Shabbat, however, your white shirt and black slacks should suffice, since you said you don't have anything else. That's what I wear everyday (black and white), and that's what I wear whenever I go to synagogue, for  Shabbat even. (I live in a place that does not have an Orthodox synagogue, so I do all my praying at home, but when I do get the chance to attend synagogue in another city I do so.)</p>\n\n<p>(It's a pretty widespread myth that Orthodox Jews wear suits everyday to synagogue.)</p>\n\n<p>As for not owning a kippah, most synagogues will have a bin by the door with kippot for visitors to use. So you could use on of those. Otherwise, a different head covering would be good. Your beanie might not be such a bad option, but during a weekday it wouldn't be strange to even wear a ballcap!</p>\n\n<p>Remember to talk to the rabbi of the synagogue you're planning to visit and explain why you want to visit before you show up to the synagogue. This way the rabbi will know your motives and will be able to help you, and he won't be surprised and accidentally stand-off-ish when you show up. Make sure to explain to him that you are not a Jew (that you only have a Jewish father) but that you're interested in converting to Judaism and want to see what it's like \"inside\". </p>\n\n<p>During the services, you might explain to your neighbors in synagogue that you're interested in learning about Judaism and more importantly, that you're not Jewish. This way they can help you if you have questions about the service, and any polite person should be happy to teach you.</p>\n\n<p>If you plan to go on Shabbat, remember that since you're not Jewish according to Jewish Law, then there should be no problem with you driving to synagogue during the Shabbat, and no one would judge you for doing so. It might be a good idea, though, to park a little ways off and walk up to the synagogue, and not park in the parking lot.</p>\n\n<p>I would actually recommend visiting on a Shabbat, so that you will get a full synagogue experience. Additionally, the prayers tend to be recited slower, since no one has to go to work right after services. Also, on Shabbat the Torah is read, whereas during the week the Torah is only read on Monday and Thursday. </p>\n\n<p>But as mentioned above, the most important thing is that you speak with the rabbi of the synagogue you want to attend.</p>\n\n<p>Good luck in your journey and welcome to Mi Yodeya. If you have any other questions, feel free to ask me in the comments of this answer.</p>\n\n<p>For further information, see <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/20281/first-trip-to-the-synagogue-tips-and-advice-please?rq=1\">this question and answer</a> elsewhere on this site.</p>\n\n<p>--- Added by <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/users/5275/danf\">DanF</a> ---</p>\n\n<p>If no one knows you there, you actually should make it known that you're a Gentile! This may sound strange, but once, in my shul, we had 10 men which included a stranger. We assumed that he was Jewish and we had a minyan. It was only when we reached Torah reading, someone asked him if he wanted to be called to the Torah. That's when he said, \"I'm not Jewish\". So, we had actually performed parts of the service assuming we had a minyan, when we really didn't. So, you - or rather the shul - wants to avoid this situation!</p>\n\n\n",

As such there is no reason to imagine one can voluntarily refrain from performing it.</p>\n<p>But does one have to pursue the mitzva if one isn't awake? An <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/a/27360/11501\">answer</a> from msh210 and a link from unforgettableid led me to a very interesting compendium on <a href=\"http://download.yutorah.org/2009/1109/735393.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Sleep in Halacha</a> by <a href=\"http://www.yutorah.org/rabbi-aryeh-lebowitz/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">R Aryeh Lebowitz</a>. He brings (section V-D, p. 12) the opinion from R Shlomo Zalman Auerbach (Halichos Shlomo, Tefilla, Miluim #12)</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>that it is obvious that while a person is sleeping he has no\nobligation to do any mitzvos, including shema and davening, because he\nis considered like a mentally disabled person (“shoteh”). This exemption from\nmitzvos, in Rav Auerbach’s view, includes both מצוות עשה (positive\ncommandments) and מצוות לא תעש (negative commandments).</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>To be clear not everyone agrees with R Auerbach but he is a <em>posek</em> of great significance. He explicitly discusses the fact people who sleep are exempt from shema.</p>\n<p>R Lebowitz continues</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Similarly, if one were sleeping, and the time for davening or shema\narrived, one would not be obligated to wake them up. The sleeping\nperson is simply not obligated in those mitzvos. However, Rabbi\nAuerbach points out, one should wake the person up in order to provide\nhim with the opportunity to fulfill the mitzvah. In short, while he\nwill not be faulted for neglecting the mitzvah, the sleeping person\ncertainly does not get credit for doing the mitzvah. For that alone,\nit is worthwhile to wake him up.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I am not clear if this means one can let oneself go to sleep and place oneself in such a situation. R Lebowitz addresses the point in the following way</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>It may be argued that a sleeping person is not considered like a\nshoteh who has no obligation in mitzvos, but like an ones who is\nexempt due to circumstances beyond his control. The difference between\nthe two can be explained as follows: A shoteh is simply not an\nintelligent person and therefore never has any relationship with a\nmitzvah. An ones on the other hand, may be included in the general\nobligation of mitzvos, but is exempt because practically he can’t be\nheld accountable.</p>\n<p>A simple practical example of where these two\nanalyses diverge is one who went to sleep knowing that he would miss\nout on a mitzvah as a result of his sleep. If the sleeping person were\nconsidered a shoteh he cannot be held accountable. If, however, he\nwere considered an ones, this would be an example of “starting off\nnegligent, but finishing with an accident beyond his control”, and he\nmay be held accountable for his failure to set up a system by which he\ncan be woken up in time for the mitzvah.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>After checking with multiple <em>talmidei chahamim</em>, no one believes the above is enough to condone going to sleep without putting an alarm clock. At best, it can allow someone who slept through to make up by saying <em>shmonei esrei</em> twice in the next prayer (<em>tashlumin</em>).</p>\n\n\n",

Let me elaborate, <em>it is on the Drush side, as usual, but might shed some light on the topic</em>. </p>\n\n<p>Let's visualize three pictures: a Jew holding a gold watch, a gentile holding a gold watch and a raven holding a gold watch. All three of them \"possess\" a watch, however, the measure of <em>possession</em> is clearly different: the Jew's watch is his by ownership, the gentile's by possession and the raven's by holding only. How?</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p><strong>When a Jew owns a thing</strong> (compare to wife) it is bound to him with some invisible strings. It stays his even if he loses control of it, loses it etc. Those bonds are sort of \"written in the heaven\" and he does not have to act anything to bequest it to his heirs. I'll call it the \"ownership\" and it is linked to <strong>the level of Neshomoh</strong> (exclusive to the Jews).</p></li>\n<li><p><strong>When a gentile possesses</strong> a thing it is not bound to him, it is only bound to the social norms and traditions - whatever is accepted in the same society. This is called the \"Dina deMalchutah\" and is pretty much arbitrary. So once the society decides something's his it's his, \"the Heavens don't bother\" as long as it is backed by the laws. That's linked to <strong>the level of Ruach</strong> and is common to all humans.</p></li>\n<li><p><strong>When an animal holds a thing</strong> we cannot possibly think of any form of possession, as the Nefesh can only be the body itself, not something external to it.</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Back to our question: <strong>The (true) ownership of the land of Israel</strong> was set by casting a fate in the times of Joshua's conquest of the Holy Land and was divided to all the families of Yozey Mizrayim. It lasted for some hundreds of years, but <strong>after the Exile of the 10 tribes and the Babylonian Exile the very idea of \"ownership of the Holy Land\" was invalidated till the times of the Moshiach</strong>. Since then we're left with the level of possession only, which is common to all humans and is bound to the Dinah deMalchutah. </p>\n\n<p>NB: This is also true for all the Jewish land ownership in the Holy Land and outside - once Moshiach comes, chances are it will be \"reshuffled\", to provide everyone with what really belongs to his Jewish soul (sort of השבת אבידה).</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Hiding in an attic\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>There's a few instances I've seen in the gemarra where there were meetings in an attic. Both that come to mind are with Rabbanan Gamliel, although I'm not sure if it occurs with others. One is the Mishnah that he had diagrams <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Mishnah_Rosh_Hashanah.2.8\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">in his attic</a> to test witnesses about the New Moon (Yachin there brings the following gemarra that this is where they accepted witnesses). The other is he formed a Beis Din <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Sanhedrin.11a.1\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">in his attic</a> to rule on the intercalation of the year (Rashi there says it was designated to be a location for a Beis Din)</p>\n\n<p>I'm wondering why specifically an attic. Was that simply his office? Or was he hiding up there. I ask because I once heard that during the times of Chazal there was a decree against learning Torah, so they had to teach in hiding, namely in their attic. Is this true?</p>\n\n<p><strong>Edit:</strong> I found another example of something happening in an attic in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Ketubot.50b.4\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Kesubos 50b</a>, this time not involving Rabban Gamliel, rather a quote from an Amora.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>דאמר רב יצחק בר יוסף בעלייה התקינו שיהו בנות ניזונות מן המטלטלין</p>\n  \n  <p>As Rav Yitzchak bar Yosef said: When the Sages sat in the upper chamber to rule on certain halakhot, <em>which they could not do in the study hall at that time due to persecution by gentiles</em>, they instituted that daughters should be sustained from movable property in addition to land.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Note: the Sefaria translation mentions what I heard, that they had to hide in the attic due to persecutions. It's coming from Rabbi Steinzaltz <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Steinsaltz_on_Ketubot.50b.4?with=all&lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">commentary</a> on that gemarra. I'm not posting this as an answer as I'd like an earlier source.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 5)\n\n<p>This is kind of an open lead. The following is either a proof for the assumption, or a source for the conflating of circumstances.</p>\n\n<p>Sanhedrin 74a discussed the vote in an attic in Lod where it was decided which sins a Jew should give up their life for:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>א''ר יוחנן משום ר''ש בן יהוצדק נימנו וגמרו בעליית בית נתזה בלוד כל עבירות שבתורה אם אומרין לאדם עבור ואל תהרג יעבור ואל יהרג חוץ מעבודת כוכבים וגילוי עריות ושפיכות דמים</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Margolios Hayam there brings the Doros Rishonim stating that this vote took place during a time of shmad, persecution, and concerned how to act during that persecution.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/DXBHQ.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/DXBHQ.jpg\" alt=\"enter image description here\"></a></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>There seems to be an assumption that a vote concerning this subject, taking place in a well known battlefront where Torah learning was outlawed, would take place secretly. The fact that the vote happened in what is commonly translated as an attic seems to sit well with this assumption. </p>\n\n<p>See <a href=\"https://books.google.com/books?id=t2bJ1UqfNXAC&pg=PA52#v=onepage&q&f=false\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a> as well where the author paints this idea very clearly.</p>\n\n<p>If I may suggest a different approach.<br>\nThis will still address why we find so many of these votes in attic Batei Dinim and not in a regular Beis Medrash. This will also perpetuate the assumption that some degree of secrecy was intended.</p>\n\n<p>We find in Avoda Zara 35a the idea that the Rabbis in Israel when instituting new restrictions would not divulge their reasoning for a year so that people wouldn't disagree and not accept their ruling.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>דאמר עולא כי גזרי גזירתא במערבא לא מגלו טעמא עד תריסר ירחי שתא דלמא איכא איניש דלא ס''ל ואתי לזלזולי בה </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>(Presumably, once the practice caught on, individuals who didn't agree with the logic wouldn't stop practicing it just because they disagreed. Or once they accepted the practice, they would assume the Rabbis were correct and wouldn't go investigating the logic behind it.)</p>\n\n<p>It is possible based on this to assume that much novel deciding of Halacha happened in private. </p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>I haven't found anything specific about <em>hiding</em>, but we have two-story houses in Israel from the time of the first temple, and no reason to believe this construction fell out of practice by the time of the mishna.  The Harvard Semitic Museum has an <a href=\"https://semiticmuseum.fas.harvard.edu/houses-ancient-israel\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">exhibit on houses of ancient Israel</a> that shows a reconstruction of such a house -- livestock on the first floor, space for people on the second.</p>\n\n<p>An uncited tamudic story in <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/a/30978/472\">this post</a> describes Rabbi Yehoshua helping a visitor up the ladder to his loft to sleep.</p>\n\n<p>Looking to the Tanakh itself, we know that Yiftach was expecting an animal to come out of \"his house\" (<a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/q/11035/472\">related</a>, and that the Shunamite woman made an upper-story room for Elisha.  </p>\n\n<p>If we're willing to consider another religion's texts for <em>historical</em> reference (obviously not religious), they have Jesus having a meal in an \"upper room\" of somebody's house.</p>\n\n<p>I would reason (no sources) that the concern about hiding expressed in the commentary isn't about the <em>first floor</em> versus the <em>second floor</em>, but rather is about the <em>beit midrash</em> (public space) versus <em>someone's house</em>.  And if you're going to be in someone's house, you naturally want to be somewhere comfortable -- and maybe not in the middle of regular household activity, if you're there to study torah or make <em>halachic</em> decisions.  An upper story sounds perfect for that.</p>\n\n\n",

What did God mean when He said (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Exodus.17.14?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Exodus 17:14</a>): \"I will blot out the memory of Amalek from under the heaven\"?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>Numbers 24:20, which gives Balaam's fifth oracle, says: </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Then Balaam saw Amalek and spoke his message:</p>\n  \n  <p>“Amalek was first among the nations,\n      but their end will be utter destruction.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>As pointed out above, the reference to blotting out the memory of Amalek is further repeated in Deuteronomy 25:17-19 and makes clear there that God will do this <strong>through the children of Israel after they have entered the land of Canaan</strong>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>17 Remember what the Amalekites did to you along the way when you came out of Egypt. 18 When you were weary and worn out, they met you on your journey and attacked all who were lagging behind; they had no fear of God. 19 When the Lord your God gives you rest from all the enemies around you in the land he is giving you to possess as an inheritance, you shall blot out the name of Amalek from under heaven. Do not forget!</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I Samuel 15 shows how this command was (partially) fulfilled <strong>in the land of Israel through the agency of Saul</strong>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>15 Samuel said to Saul, “I am the one the Lord sent to anoint you king over his people Israel; so listen now to the message from the Lord. 2 This is what the Lord Almighty says: ‘I will punish the Amalekites for what they did to Israel when they waylaid them as they came up from Egypt. 3 Now go, attack the Amalekites and totally destroy all that belongs to them. Do not spare them; put to death men and women, children and infants, cattle and sheep, camels and donkeys.’”</p>\n  \n  <p>4 So Saul summoned the men and mustered them at Telaim—two hundred thousand foot soldiers and ten thousand from Judah. 5 Saul went to the city of Amalek and set an ambush in the ravine. 6 Then he said to the Kenites, “Go away, leave the Amalekites so that I do not destroy you along with them; for you showed kindness to all the Israelites when they came up out of Egypt.” So the Kenites moved away from the Amalekites.</p>\n  \n  <p>7 Then Saul attacked the Amalekites all the way from Havilah to Shur, near the eastern border of Egypt. 8 He took Agag king of the Amalekites alive, and all his people he totally destroyed with the sword. 9 But Saul and the army spared Agag and the best of the sheep and cattle, the fat calves and lambs—everything that was good. These they were unwilling to destroy completely, but everything that was despised and weak they totally destroyed.</p>\n  \n  <p>10 Then the word of the Lord came to Samuel: 11 “I regret that I have made Saul king, because he has turned away from me and has not carried out my instructions.” Samuel was angry, and he cried out to the Lord all that night.</p>\n  \n  <p>12 Early in the morning Samuel got up and went to meet Saul, but he was told, “Saul has gone to Carmel. There he has set up a monument in his own honor and has turned and gone on down to Gilgal.”</p>\n  \n  <p>13 When Samuel reached him, Saul said, “The Lord bless you! I have carried out the Lord’s instructions.”</p>\n  \n  <p>14 But Samuel said, “What then is this bleating of sheep in my ears? What is this lowing of cattle that I hear?”</p>\n  \n  <p>15 Saul answered, “The soldiers brought them from the Amalekites; they spared the best of the sheep and cattle to sacrifice to the Lord your God, but we totally destroyed the rest.”</p>\n  \n  <p>16 “Enough!” Samuel said to Saul. “Let me tell you what the Lord said to me last night.”</p>\n  \n  <p>“Tell me,” Saul replied.</p>\n  \n  <p>17 Samuel said, “Although you were once small in your own eyes, did you not become the head of the tribes of Israel? The Lord anointed you king over Israel. 18 And he sent you on a mission, saying, ‘Go and completely destroy those wicked people, the Amalekites; wage war against them until you have wiped them out.’ 19 Why did you not obey the Lord? Why did you pounce on the plunder and do evil in the eyes of the Lord?”</p>\n  \n  <p>20 “But I did obey the Lord,” Saul said. “I went on the mission the Lord assigned me. I completely destroyed the Amalekites and brought back Agag their king. 21 The soldiers took sheep and cattle from the plunder, the best of what was devoted to God, in order to sacrifice them to the Lord your God at Gilgal.”</p>\n  \n  <p>22 But Samuel replied:</p>\n  \n  <p>“Does the Lord delight in burnt offerings and sacrifices\n      as much as in obeying the Lord?\n  To obey is better than sacrifice,\n      and to heed is better than the fat of rams.\n  23 For rebellion is like the sin of divination,\n      and arrogance like the evil of idolatry.\n  Because you have rejected the word of the Lord,\n      he has rejected you as king.”\n  24 Then Saul said to Samuel, “I have sinned. I violated the Lord’s command and your instructions. I was afraid of the men and so I gave in to them. 25 Now I beg you, forgive my sin and come back with me, so that I may worship the Lord.”</p>\n  \n  <p>26 But Samuel said to him, “I will not go back with you. You have rejected the word of the Lord, and the Lord has rejected you as king over Israel!”</p>\n  \n  <p>27 As Samuel turned to leave, Saul caught hold of the hem of his robe, and it tore. 28 Samuel said to him, “The Lord has torn the kingdom of Israel from you today and has given it to one of your neighbors—to one better than you. 29 He who is the Glory of Israel does not lie or change his mind; for he is not a human being, that he should change his mind.”</p>\n  \n  <p>30 Saul replied, “I have sinned. But please honor me before the elders of my people and before Israel; come back with me, so that I may worship the Lord your God.” 31 So Samuel went back with Saul, and Saul worshiped the Lord.</p>\n  \n  <p>32 Then Samuel said, “Bring me Agag king of the Amalekites.”</p>\n  \n  <p>Agag came to him in chains. And he thought, “Surely the bitterness of death is past.”</p>\n  \n  <p>33 But Samuel said,</p>\n  \n  <p>“As your sword has made women childless,\n      so will your mother be childless among women.”\n  And Samuel put Agag to death before the Lord at Gilgal.</p>\n  \n  <p>34 Then Samuel left for Ramah, but Saul went up to his home in Gibeah of Saul. 35 Until the day Samuel died, he did not go to see Saul again, though Samuel mourned for him. And the Lord regretted that he had made Saul king over Israel.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I Samuel 27:8 makes clear that Saul and his men did not kill all the Amalekites, for we find there David killing some in Ziklag:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>27 But David thought to himself, “One of these days I will be destroyed by the hand of Saul. The best thing I can do is to escape to the land of the Philistines. Then Saul will give up searching for me anywhere in Israel, and I will slip out of his hand.”</p>\n  \n  <p>2 So David and the six hundred men with him left and went over to Achish son of Maok king of Gath. 3 David and his men settled in Gath with Achish. Each man had his family with him, and David had his two wives: Ahinoam of Jezreel and Abigail of Carmel, the widow of Nabal. 4 When Saul was told that David had fled to Gath, he no longer searched for him.</p>\n  \n  <p>5 Then David said to Achish, “If I have found favor in your eyes, let a place be assigned to me in one of the country towns, that I may live there. Why should your servant live in the royal city with you?”</p>\n  \n  <p>6 So on that day Achish gave him Ziklag, and it has belonged to the kings of Judah ever since. 7 David lived in Philistine territory a year and four months.</p>\n  \n  <p>8 Now David and his men went up and raided the Geshurites, the Girzites and the Amalekites. (From ancient times these peoples had lived in the land extending to Shur and Egypt.) 9 Whenever David attacked an area, he did not leave a man or woman alive, but took sheep and cattle, donkeys and camels, and clothes. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>That there were still more Amalekites elsewhere we find from I Samuel 30:1-2, where we are told that the Amalekites have taken revenge on David for his slaughter of their people in Ziklag:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>30 David and his men reached Ziklag on the third day. Now the Amalekites had raided the Negev and Ziklag. They had attacked Ziklag and burned it, 2 and had taken captive the women and everyone else in it, both young and old. They killed none of them, but carried them off as they went on their way.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I Chron. 4:42-43 states that in the time of Hezekiah five hundred Simeonites annihilated the last remnant \"of the Amalekites that had escaped\" on Mount Seir and settled there in the place of Amalek.</p>\n\n<p>On Purim, observant Jews drink to celebrate the blotting out of the nation of Amalek, of whom Haman is said to be a descendant (Esther 3:1).  </p>\n\n<p>Reform Judaism considers the ban against Amalek a primitive element in Tanakh and unacceptable for modern society.

(Breishit 36:2)\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>There appears to be a Torah contradiction regarding the statement that Esav took his wives from among the women in the land of Cana'an as stated in <a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=9597&st=&pgnum=460\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Breishit 36:2</a>.</p>\n\n<p>verse 2 lists Adah, whom Rash\"i says was Basmat bat Eilon (not to be confused with the \"Basmat\" mentioned in verse 3) and Ahalivamah, whom Rash\"i says is Yehudit.</p>\n\n<p>verse 3 mentions Basmat bat Yishma'el (whom Rash\"i says is Machla) </p>\n\n<p>Looking back at <a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=9597&st=&pgnum=340&hilite=\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Breishit 26:34</a>, we see that two of his wives, Yehudit and Basmat were, indeed from Cana'an. But in <a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=9597&st=&pgnum=358&hilite=\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Breishit 28:8-9</a> it says that because Esav saw that his father didn't like the women from Cana'an, he specifically took Machalat as his wife. So Machalat, was <strong>not</strong> from the women of Cana'an. How does that reconcile with 36:2 that implies that all his wives were women from Cana'an?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>To start with, there is the question of whether one accepts the Midrashic interpretation that he had a total of three wives who went by different names. However, whether or not one does, the question still stands. Genesis (36:2) states that his wives were from Canaan, while verse 3 says that בשמת was the daughter of Yishmael, who would not be thought of as a Canaanite. However, whether or not one identifies בשמת as מחלת, the question stands.</p>\n\n<p>One simple reconciliation is that (36:2) which states that he married Canaanites refers specifically to the wives in that verse; Adah and Aholivama were are identified as being from the tribes of the Hitti and the Hivi. Verse 3, however, refers to a non-Canaanite wife; בשמת בת ישמעאל. Rav Saadya Gaon (Tafsir to that verse) seems to suggest this reading by rendering \"Esav took his wives from Canaan,\" to \"Esav took wives from Canaan\". That is, the verse is just saying that he married wives from Canaan, not that all his wives were from Canaan.</p>\n\n<p>This explanation stands whether or not one aligns Aholivama with Yehudit and Adah with בשמת בת אילון. </p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>In addition to mevaqesh's answer, he married the Canaanite wives (or at least some of them, without the midrashic name flips) when he was 40.   He didn't marry Machalat until 46 (midrash about Yaakov spending 14 years with Ever) or 60 (without that midrash) years later.  That's about as long as many lifelong marriages last. They could have been called \"his wives\" just because they were his only wives for such a long time.</p>\n\n\n",

So I would like to what is the difference between the two? Is the title of senior rabbi simply honorary or do they have a higher position than the others? </p>\n\n<p>I apologise if my questions may simply be idiotic, but I am genuinely looking for answers. Thank you for your time.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 8)\n\n<p>This answer is based on my experience only, which is primarily with Orthodox synagogues.</p>\n\n<p>Many synagogues have many members who happen to have completed the requisite course of study and become rabbis, but are not employed by the synagogue and work as, for example, accountants or bootblacks. But you don't seem to be asking about such people, so the rest of my answer will be devoted to rabbis employed by the synagogue.</p>\n\n<p>Most synagogues have but one rabbi. He advises the synagogue board, and in many cases makes decisions binding on the synagogue, regarding spiritual matters. He also answers members' (and others') questions about all matters religious or pastoral, officiates at members' (and sometimes others') lifecycle events when asked (though most are not trained to circumcise), gives lectures in the synagogue, and sometimes leads synagogue services.</p>\n\n<p>Many synagogues have two rabbis. The second fulfills the above roles when the first is unable; this is common in large congregations where there may be many such tasks to do. Sometimes the second has a designated role as, for example, youth rabbi, in charge of youth programming and lectures and leading youth-oriented services; or as, for example, programming director. Other times his title is simple \"assistant rabbi\" or the like. (Many synagogues hire programming directors or the like who are not rabbis, too.)</p>\n\n<p>And some synagogues have more than two, especially if the congregation's size supports and requires it. And some have none at all.</p>\n\n<p>Some synagogues have a rabbi listed as \"emeritus\" or sometimes as \"senior\". He does little or no work and is typically the former rabbi of the synagogue, who still draws a stipend for his past work. But \"senior rabbi\" can also mean the main rabbi of a congregation.</p>\n\n<p>Also, occasionally, a rabbi-in-training serves a temporary stint with a congregation.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>Supplemental to @msh210's answer, based on what I have seen in mainly Orthodox as well as a number of Conservative shuls.</p>\n\n<p>The assistant rabbi is a vague definition and has a good bit of variance. As msh210 mentioned, frequently, he substitutes for the rabbi when he is absent. However, in many shuls the assistant rabbi performs behind-the-scenes administrative functions. The main rabbi will give the sermons and you tend to see him at almost every minyan as he \"represents\" the shul. The assistant takes care of the \"halachic paperwork\" and scheduling. For example, he may be the one to meet with B;nai / B'not mitzvah for religious advice. He may meet with families to discuss family problems / issues. If there is a wedding, he counsels the couple on halacha matters and perhaps advises on the exact phrasing of the ketubah. The assistant may be the first contact when someone dies. I.e. he' sbehind the scenes assisting the main rabbi in his daily scheduling - part \"secretary\" part rabbi.</p>\n\n<p>In the past 2 decades, I've noticed many shuls that have a rabbi trainee. I.e., he's a recent rabbinical school grad who acts as an \"intern\" in the shul for 1 to perhaps 3 years gaining useful career experience. Occasionally, they may have him give sermons and he may do some administrative duties.</p>\n\n\n",

Thus as he explains in the dream of the butler</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>If one thinks that through dreams or othe symbolic signs that the One\n  who sends the dream to the mind of a person wishes therebye to tell\n  him something, the kind of symbol in the dream must be of such a\n  natuer that the receiver of it can explain it to himself; it must be\n  clear and apparent. He who hears the explanation must, if it is the\n  correct one, be able to say to himself:\"I really ought to have thought\n  that out myself\".</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Indeed, Rav Hirsch on 40:16 also says that the worth of the explanation is seen in the truth of the words. and that</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>All that Josph added was that the three tendils which the vine had\n  then to mature to blossoms and grapes were three days which still had\n  to pass.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>As Rav Hirsch says on Vayeishev 40:17](<a href=\"http://www.chabad.org/library/bible_cdo/aid/8235#v=17&showrashi=true\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">http://www.chabad.org/library/bible_cdo/aid/8235#v=17&showrashi=true</a>)</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>And in the topmost basket were all kinds of Pharaoh's food, the work\n  of a baker, and the birds were eating them from the basket atop my\n  head.\"</p>\n  \n  <p>All the food was worthy for Pharaoh and yet it was not he but the\n  birds who ate it, and indeed they had the impudence to eat it away\n  from me from the basket on my head.

All he could do was tell him what the meaning of the dream was so that he could spend the next three days preparing for his death. Indeed, once he had explained it, it became obvious to him what would happen and any attempt to soften the explanation would be regarded as an insult.</p>\n\n<p>As you suspected, the language had to be similar in order to show the accuracy of the two dreams. This is in order to say that these to dreams are closely related in that both will be <code>יִשָּׂ֤א פַרְעֹה֙ אֶת־רֹאשֶׁ֔ךָ</code> after three days with the difference in final results as shown by the ending of the dreams. Note the trop (cantillation marks) on the two phrases to show how they are related.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>I haven't seen this directly addressed, but here's my own theory based on the explanation of the Chidah, who explains that from the the baker's saying \"from on my head\" (which was unnecessary, as he had already mentioned where the baskets were), Yosef understood that subconsciously the baker realized (his mazal saw) that he was going to die and was expressing it with this extra phrase. Maybe Yosef, in confirming this subliminal understanding, chose to employ the same wording of מעליך, and it wasn't really getting the baker's hopes up, as on some level the baker already knew the truth.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: -1)\n\n<p>As is clear in the posuk, the baker only approached Yosef for an interpretation of his dream upon seeing the butler coming out with good news.</p>\n\n<p>Seeing this it is safe to differentiate between the baker and the butler in that the butler was seeking the true message of his dream whereas the baker was going for the good news only, which means he was masquerading, pretending to be an innocent person seeking for the message relayed to him  when in truth he was not which made him a liar.</p>\n\n<p>It is important to note that when the Torah tells of someone lying or any other trait be it good or bad, it is a deeply rooted attribute of that person.For the Torah is very relevant and concise and in a posuk or two the Torah brings out the essence of the person spoken about. This is as we see that the Torah highlights Avraham's attribute of Chesed in a mere few pesukim and in Chazal's eyes it is this facet and virtue which stood as his merit forever.</p>\n\n<p>The Midrash Bereishit Rabba  (19:2) points out four that began their remark with the word 'Aff' meaning anger and were lost with that word, one of them being our baker. Now see the pirush Maharza'v on the Midrash who explains that these four were up to cruelty which brought this terminology to their tongue's. This illustrates to us how Chazal took every word that any character uttered and used that to explain their entire predicament. </p>\n\n<p>Well, the posuk in Shmuel b' 22' says \"with a crook act crooked\".Yosef, replying to the baker's dishonest request in searching for the dream's true meaning, answered him accordingly, by appearing as though ready to glorify his quest for the good news.  </p>\n\n<p>Another understanding; the butler dreamt that he was serving the king again which meant that this was good news for him whereas the baker would not even dream of baking for the king again, as we do not see him dreaming that he carried the food to the king, showing us all that good news for him was anything but serving the king again   </p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Source for the words Nes Gadol Haya Sham\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>Several articles <a href=\"http://forward.com/culture/yiddish-culture/326379/the-true-history-of-the-dreidel/?attribution=home-hero-item-text-3\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">such as this one</a> and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dreidel\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">this wikipedia article</a> claim that the custom of the dreidel have nothing to do with Chanukah. <a href=\"https://www.myjewishlearning.com/article/the-origin-of-the-dreidel/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Myjewishlearning</a> has the following to say about the custom:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>In England and Ireland there is a game called totum or teetotum that is especially popular at Christmastime. In English, this game is first mentioned as “totum” ca. 1500-1520. The name comes from the Latin “totum,” which means “all.” By 1720, the game was called T- totum or teetotum, and by 1801 the four letters already represented four words in English: T = Take all; H = Half; P = Put down; and N = Nothing.</p>\n  \n  <p>Our Eastern European game of dreidel (including the letters nun, gimmel, hey, shin) is directly based on the German equivalent of the totum game: N = Nichts = nothing; G = Ganz = all; H = Halb = half; and S = Stell ein = put in....\n  Thus the dreidel game represents an irony of Jewish history. In order to celebrate the holiday of Hanukkah, which celebrates our victory over cultural assimilation, we play the dreidel game, which is an excellent example of cultural assimilation! Of course, there is a world of difference between imitating non-Jewish games and worshiping idols, but the irony remains nonetheless.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Does anyone know of an early source (Rishonim or earlier) for the phrase \"Nes Gadol Haya Sham?\" Is it all really a \"Sham\" (pun intended) or is there any chance it was actually used by the Jews since the times of Chanukah? Did it exist off the dreidel? Do we refer to Chanukah as a Nes Gadol anywhere in early sources?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 6)\n\n<p>According to <a href=\"http://seforim.blogspot.com/2005/12/chanukah-customs-and-sources.html?m=1\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">this article</a>, the earliest mention of the significance of dreidel is in the late 18th century, and the first mention of it having been done in the time of Chanukah is from 1890.</p>\n\n<p>So, there is no evidence that it was done since then, and it is not mentioned by rishonim.</p>\n\n<p>Regarding nes gadol haya sham, <a href=\"http://beta.hebrewbooks.org/reader/reader.aspx?sfid=41445#p=160&fitMode=fitwidth&hlts=&ocr=%25u05E0%25u05E1%20%25u05D2%25u05D3%25u05D5%25u05DC%20%25u05D4%25u05D9%25u05D4%20%25u05E9%25u05DD\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">this source</a> from 1911 implies it, as does <a href=\"http://beta.hebrewbooks.org/reader/reader.aspx?sfid=39192#p=1&fitMode=fitwidth&hlts=&ocr=%25u05E0%25u05E1%20%25u05D2%25u05D3%25u05D5%25u05DC%20%25u05D4%25u05D9%25u05D4%20%25u05E9%25u05DD\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">this source</a> from 1913. I couldn't find earlier sources on HebrewBooks or the Bar Ilan responsa project.</p>\n\n<p>It is unsurprising that somewhere in all of Jewish literature, one would find the great miracles of Chanukah referred to as a great miracle. For example, in the 13th century R. Yehoshua ibn Shuib writes (Derashot Parashat Mikets):</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>וכן עשה השם בזמן חשמונאים שעשה השם נס גדול ונסתר שמסר גבורים ביד חלשים ורבים ביד מעטים בימי מתתיה בן יוחנן כהן גדול חשמונאי </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>However, as noted, there is no reason whatsoever to think that the practice of dreidel, dates back to the time of Chanukkah. That would require that it remain unmentioned for over 1800 years, during which time we find it only as a non-Jewish toy, with no mention of any Jewish significance. There is certainly no reason to assume that the lettering originated in Hebrew, given that the oldest sources for it are not in Hebrew. There is further no reason that when we do find Hebrew paralleling the existing German, that it is somehow the original. If it were the case, this must have been a secret for literally thousands of years from the time of Chanukkah until the \"nes gadol haya\" sham is mentioned. A secret so well guarded, that not a word spilled, and no evidence was found. </p>\n\n<p>It's kind of like suggesting that 'Yahoo' really stands for \"Yet Another Hierarchical Officious Oracle\", and that early records of the reason for the name, are a cover up, or mistake. The only difference, is that the previous example doesn't require imaging the existence of a secret two thousand year old train of knowledge, so secret that no one ever whispered of it.</p>\n\n<p>In short no evidence whatsoever at all, and all evidence to the contrary.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 3)\n\n<p><a href=\"http://dinonline.org/2015/12/07/the-chanukah-dreidel-and-its-halachos/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">dinonline</a> has interesting things to say on the topic</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Nobody can say with certainty when the custom of playing dreidel on\n  Chanukah first began. <strong>The idea is not found in sources from Talmudic\n  times or even in the era of Geonim and Rishonim. Its first mention is\n  by Ashkenazi authorities of the Eighteenth Century (though the custom\n  might be older).</strong></p>\n  \n  <p>[...]</p>\n  \n  <p>According to one source, the custom of playing dreidel relates to the\n  time of the Maccabees. It is said that in an effort to circumvent the\n  Greek decree against studying Torah, children studying with their\n  teacher would have a dreidel handy to start playing in case the Greeks\n  came upon them while they were studying Torah. They would say that\n  they were not studying but just playing dreidel. In commemoration of\n  this element of the Chanukah miracle, the dreidel game was adopted as\n  a custom (Rabbi A. Hirschovitz, Minhagei Yeshurun (1890), no. 19, sec.\n  4).</p>\n  \n  <p>[...]</p>\n  \n  <p>Playing the dreidel is clearly not obligatory. Nonetheless [...] a number of prominent authorities give it the respect of a full\n  Minhag Yisrael.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Regarding Nes Gadol Haya Sham, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dreidel\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Wikipedia</a> brings some theories building on the totum you bring in your question</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Adapted to the Hebrew alphabet when Jews adopted the game, these\n  letters were replaced by shin (=shtel arayn (put in); nun (= nit (not,\n  i.e., nothing); gimel, representing gants (whole/everything); and he\n  (=halb (half)). The letters served as a means to recalling the rules\n  of the game.</p>\n  \n  <p><strong>This theory states that when the game spread to Jewish communities\n  unfamiliar with Yiddish, the denotations of the Hebrew letters were\n  not understood. As a result, there arose Jewish traditions to explain\n  their assumed meaning.</strong> However, in Judaism there are often multiple\n  explanations developed for words. Some claimed the 4 letters cyphered\n  Babylon, Persia, Greece and the Roman Empire, the four ancient empires\n  that tried to destroy Israel; a gematriya reading yielded the number\n  358, identical to the value of the 4 letters used for Moshiach\n  (Messiah). A third popular conjecture had it that the letters\n  abbreviated the words nes gadol haya sham (a great miracle happened\n  there), an idea that became attached to dreidels when the game entered\n  into Hanukkah festivities.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Despite this different explanations have been offered on the significance of the dreidel on Chanuka, e.g., </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The Bnei Yissachar writes that the reason a dreidel is spun from the\n  top, whereas the Purim gragger turned from the bottom, is related to\n  how each of the miracles were effected. On Chanukah the miracle came\n  from above, directly from Hashem. However, on Purim the miracles were\n  brought about by the actions of Esther, Mordechai and the Jewish\n  people from below.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>The ספר התודעה explains that it was a game given to the kids to occupy themselves after  Chanuka Candle lighting, the game was then infused with a meaning that would strengthen the children's emunah so the time was wasted. Hence the connection  of the letters to  Hashem doing a great miracle there. </p>\n\n\n",

This was because Eliphaz Esau’s son pursued Jacob by his father’s order to kill him, and overtook him. But because Eliphaz had been brought up on Isaac’s lap, (cp. Deuteronomy Rabbah 2:13) he withheld his hand. He said to him (Jacob), “But what shall I do as regards my father’s order?” Jacob replied, “Take all I have and you can say that I am dead for a poor man may be accounted as dead\" (Nedarim 64b).</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Assuming that Yaakov and Eliphaz's plan succeeded, Eisav would have been under the impression that Yaakov was dead.

And he kept close to Jacob, and he ‎lay in wait for him at the boundary of Canaan, opposite the city of Shechem. And when Jacob ‎saw Eliphaz and his men following him, Jacob halted in his way to ascertain what this meant, ‎for he knew nothing about it. But Eliphaz drew his sword and advanced towards Jacob with his ‎men. And Jacob said unto them: What is the cause of your coming hither, and for what reason ‎do you follow me with your naked swords? And Eliphaz approached him, saying: Thus hath my ‎father instructed me to do, and neither shall I depart from the orders which my father hath ‎given me. And when Jacob heard that Esau had spoken unto Eliphaz to use all his force, Jacob ‎came near unto them and entreated Eliphaz and his men, saying: Behold, here is all that I have, ‎and which was given me by my father and mother, take all this and leave me and do not kill ‎me, and may this deed be accounted unto thee a righteousness. And the Lord caused Jacob to ‎find favor in the eyes of Eliphaz and his men, and they listened to the voice of Jacob, and they ‎did not slay him. And Eliphaz and his men took away all that Jacob had, as also the silver and ‎gold that he had brought from Beersheba; they did not leave him the least thing. <strong>And Eliphaz ‎went away with his men, and they returned to Esau, to Beersheba, and they informed him of ‎all that had happened unto them with Jacob, and they delivered to him all that they had taken ‎from Jacob.

And they excused themselves, saying: Because Jacob entreated us not ‎to slay him, and our compassion was aroused in his behalf, hence we took of him all he had ‎and brought it unto thee. And Esau took all the silver and gold which Eliphaz had taken from ‎Jacob and stored it away in his house.

    "content": "# Dovid got lifespan from Adam and/or the Avos\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>I think it's pretty well known that there's an idea that 70 years from Adam's life were given to Dovid Hamelech, which is why he lived to 930 and not 1000. A source that I found for this is <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Zohar.1.168a.7\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Zohar Vayishlach 168a</a>.</p>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Zohar.1.168a.9\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">next part</a> of the Zohar points out that Avraham lived 5 years short (of Yitzchak's lifespan of 180), Yaakov 28 (from Avraham's lifespan of 175), and Yosef 37 (from Yaakov's lifespan of 147). This also adds to 70, telling us they all gave Dovid his 70 year lifespan.</p>\n<p>Since Dovid lived to 70 and not 140, how are both these two statements true? Or are they in conflict?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 9)\n\n<p>Yes at first glance they are in conflict. Sefer Yosef Tehilos 42:9 (Chida) reconciles this with the explanation that David did not sleep and this the nights counted towards the 140 years.</p>\n\n<p>יומם יצוה ה׳ חסדו ובלילה שירה עמי תפלה לאל חיי — אפשר במ״ש רז״ל, דאדם הראשון נתן לו ע׳ שנה לדוד הע״ה. ובזהר הקדוש אמר דאברהם אע״ה ויעקב אע״ה ויוסף הצדיק ע״ה נתנו לו ע׳ שנה לדוד הע״ה. ומקשים דהי״ל לחיות דהע״ה ק״ם שנה, ולא חי אלא ע׳ לבד. ותירצו, דכיון דדוד הע״ה לא ישן, א״כ הלילות נחשבו לו כימים, ונמצא שחי ע׳ שנה לילות וע׳ שנה ימים, זהת״ד. ובזהר הקדוש האריך במעלות הקם בחצות, ובכלל נמשך עליו חוט של חסד.</p>\n\n\n### ✅ Antwort 2 (Score: 5)\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.kshul.com/rabbi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><strong>Rav Daniel Glatstein</strong></a> last night gave a shiur on Hoshana Rabbah (<em>Ushpizin</em> of Dovid HaMelech), and addressed this question. You can watch it <a href=\"https://www.torahanytime.com/#/lectures?v=126331\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a>; it starts at 19:45.

However, that was before he sinned with the fruit. Once he ate the fruit, those years became spoiled, and couldn't be given to Dovid. Therefore, the <em>Avos</em> had to step in.</li>\n<li>The <a href=\"https://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=14472&st=&pgnum=136\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><strong>Ben Yehoyada</strong></a> to <strong>Shabbos</strong> 30a <em>s.v.</em> הודעני says that Adam intended to give Dovid 70 years, but then changed his mind. The <em>Avos</em> gave instead. The <a href=\"https://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=19726&st=&pgnum=168\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><strong>Shela HaKadosh</strong></a> in his commentary on the Siddur also says Adam tried to back out of his promise.

Although, he does say that Adam in the end was convinced to keep his promise, so according to him it's not really an answer.</li>\n<li>He brought the answer from the <strong>Chida</strong> that @GershonGold gave. Although, he cited it from his <em>sefer</em> <a href=\"https://tablet.otzar.org/book/book.php?book=83899&pagenum=22\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><strong>Midbar Kadeimos</strong></a> <em>Daled</em> § 6.

    "title": "Homosexual behavior from nature not prohibited?",
    "content": "# Homosexual behavior from nature not prohibited?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>I watched a Dutch Jewish television program about someone who shows his love for the Talmud and tries to translate it and give some interpretations of it. At the end of the program he asks the following question to Rabbi Nathan Lopes Cardozo: \"Nature is created by G-d, He is the Creator of all nature. If 10% of the Lions - which G-d made this way - show homosexual behavior, then why is it that regarding humans it is taught that it's a abomination or abhorrence?\" </p>\n\n<p>Before this the rabbi talked about the room for interpretation and the symbolic approach of a lot of verses. At this point he gives the following answer based on the word: 'toevah': It means something in which you are mistaken, and it's certain that there is a prohibition of homosexuality for heterosexuals. If you are heterosexual from nature it's not allowed to behave in a homosexual way. But if you are really homosexual, the Torah isn't talking about that, but there is a big problem, also in science, which is how does one determine what someone is by nature from birth on? Besides it's not like there is a choice, the normal way is for humans to be heterosexual in order to reproduce, but again one is really homosexual by nature the Torah doesn't prohibit it.\" </p>\n\n<p>Are there any commentaries and rabbinical discussions on this word toevah in regard to this topic? </p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>Rabbi Cardozo's starting point is the <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Nedarim.51a?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Talmud, Nedarim 51a</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>א\"ל בר קפרא לרבי מאי (ויקרא כ, יג) תועבה כל דא\"ל רבי דהכין הוא תועבה פרכה בר קפרא א\"ל פרשיה את א\"ל תיתי דביתכי תירמי לי נטלא אתת רמיא ליה א\"ל לר' קום רקוד לי דאימר לך הכי אמר רחמנא תועבה תועה אתה בה</p>\n<p>Bar Kappara said to Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi at the wedding: What is the meaning of the word to’eva, abomination, used by the Torah to describe homosexual intercourse (see Leviticus 18:22)? Whatever it was that Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi said to bar Kappara in explanation, claiming that this is the meaning of to’eva, bar Kappara refuted it by proving otherwise. Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi said to him: You explain it. Bar Kappara said to him: Let your wife come and pour me a goblet of wine. She came and poured him wine. Bar Kappara then said to Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi: Arise and dance for me, so that I will tell you the meaning of the word: <strong>This is what the Merciful One is saying in the Torah in the word to’eva: You are straying after it [to’e ata bah], i.e., after an atypical mate.</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Bar Kappara (who seems from context to be a bit of a joker) suggested that  the Hebrew word \"to'eva\" could mean \"to'eh ata ba\", <em>you're wandering/straying about it.</em></p>\n<p>(Note that this story is almost an aside about people's interesting personalities, and wasn't used by the Talmud in a legal context ...)</p>\n<p>I won't comment on how anyone interpreted anything from there; but that was clearly Rabbi Cardozo's reference.</p>\n\n\n",

It may also have taken time to confirm that the news was in fact valid and reliable. </p>\n\n<p>I would like to understand if there was any sort of 'grace' period for establishing a new Rabbinic holiday or if all such holidays went into effect immediately and were binding right away. </p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: -9)\n\n<p><strong>Some background information:</strong> I think you might misunderstand the very idea of Rabbis in times of the Second Temple and up to the signing of the Talmud. As we know, the winner <strong>re/writes</strong> history. That's what happened, in my understanding, with our sources - all of them were \"aligned\" with the winning Pharisee view, especially presenting our forefathers (up to the second Temple time) as keeping exclusively the Pharisee tradition for all times.</p>\n<p>This is not true, of course. Practically all of the Rabbinical rulings were a matter of public acceptance over long, long time. The fact that the Mishna itself is full of mutual nonacceptance of numerous Rabbis proves it. Many even question the \"one vs many\" rule and many times one wins over many. This is especially weird in times of the functioning Sanhedrin, where the question could be simply ruled by voting, but nobody used that option, proving that there was no unanimously accepted Halakhah until Rambam and Shulchan Aruch.</p>\n<p>Another point to keep in mind - <strong>there were no written laws before the Mishnah</strong>, everyone wrote notes to themselves, so instituting a ruling was practically impossible.</p>\n<p>Also, during the Second Temple <strong>the Rabbis had no social or political influence to enforce their ruling upon the masses</strong>. Jews were scattered all over a huge region with no central power. Even under R'Gamliel's political alliances, it was very local. Remember R'Yoshua, who did not accept R'Gamliel's ruling of Rosh Chodesh (Berachot 18)? The Talmud is full of such examples when Rabbis had conflicting customs in different towns and even neighborhoods of the same town.</p>\n<p><strong>To your question of Chanukkah:</strong> Same here. The way the Talmud presents it, as hinted in the Torah and practiced for generations, is simply wrong. Established by the Hasmoneans, it was not widely practiced until long after the destruction of the Temple; so much so that it did not make a dent in the Mishna.</p>\n<p>It is also true nowadays. Rabbis write their ruling as sort of \"שלח לחמך על פני המים\" - \"spread your crumbs over the water\" as they have no real enforcement power, and it takes years and sometimes decades and more to see, which rulings are accepted and which are not and by whom.</p>\n\n\n",

However, that may only apply in cases where the future danger is likely. In cases where the danger is unlikely, even those poskim might be stringent. Some poskim are lenient in cases where there is a current indication (such as a genetic mutation) that makes it likely that in the future a person will become dangerously ill. This is in between a case of current pikuah nefesh, and future pikuah nefesh.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eliezer_Berkovits\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">R. Eliezer Berkovitz</a> notes in <em>Berur Halakha B'din Nittuhei Metim</em> (printed in in Sinai (69 pp. 45-66)) that Sanhedrin (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Sanhedrin.26a.7?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">26a</a>) states in explanation of the statement of R. Shimon in Sanhedrin (3:3) that when the tax collectors became abundant, people would work the fields during the shemittah year. Tosafot there (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Tosafot_on_Sanhedrin.26a.7.1?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">s.v. misherabu</a>) explains in the second answer that if they didn't have have the grain they would be unable to pay their taxes and would be killed. Therefore, it was considered pikuah nefesh and they could violate biblical commands.</p>\n\n<p>It appears that (according to this) in a case where one knows that in the future lives will be endangered, he may take steps now, even in violation of biblical law, to prevent it.</p>\n\n<p>Similarly, the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avrohom_Yeshaya_Karelitz\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Hazon Ish</a> ruled (<a href=\"http://beta.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=14334&st=&pgnum=486\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">YD Hilkhot Avelut 208:7</a>) regarding performing autopsies (otherwise forbidden as mutilation of the dead) to gain medical knowledge to save lives, that it would be permissible even if the theoretical patients whose lives would be saved are not here right now, as long as it is is a common disease, such that it is known that someone in the future will be affected by it.</p>\n\n<p>This is also the opinion of <a href=\"http://beta.hebrewbooks.org/rambam.aspx?rid=1196&bid=21&hilite=\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">R. Yosef Brandesdorfer</a> in <a href=\"http://beta.hebrewbooks.org/rambam.aspx?mfid=8984&rid=1196\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Orah V'Simha to Hilkhot Shabbat (2:23)</a>.</p>\n\n<p>For a related discussion see Teshuvot V'hanhagot (3:105).</p>\n\n<p>However, while it is true that according to some views biblical law can be violated now to prevent future loss of life, those cases are apparently cases in which it is very likely that life will be endangered, and in the case of Tosafot, where it is very likely that violating the prohibition will solve the problem. However, although normally even if someone only might be in danger (e.g. a person is buried under rubble and he may or may not already be dead) we allow violation of biblical commandments, and similarly, we violate biblical commandments even where the treatment is guaranteed to be effective, perhaps in cases of future danger to life, the degree of certainty that there will be a danger and and that the treatment would need to be effective, are higher.</p>\n\n<p>Notably, in discussing removal of ovaries and Fallopian tubes from women undergoing hysterectomies, assuming that there is a 5% chance of cancer developing there, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moshe_Feinstein\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">R. Moshe Feinstein</a> in Igrot Moshe (HM 2:73) does not mention pikuah nefesh / danger in that case, as a reason to be lenient, except as an afterthought. His primary reasoning only invokes details relevant to that particular case:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>ליכא שום חשיבות ושם השחתה על מה שנשארו השחלות וצנורות הרחם והוי זה כצער וחבלה בשאר אבריה שלטובתה אין לאסור </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>He does mention the possible future danger as more of a reason to be lenient:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>וגם הא שעלול להעשות סרטן אף שהוא רק בסך חמשה אחוזים יש להחשיב סכנה להאשה להתיר זה דהוא חשש גדול </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>There is also a case between imminent pikuah nefesh, and future pikuah nefesh. That is a case in which there is currently a factor that that makes a future danger likely.

However the follicle sits further inside the skin where no razor not standard or electric could reach.

So the question to answer for those who allow electric razors, is whether they are closer to a razor (blade) or to a scissor.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.zomet.org.il/eng/?CategoryID=163&ArticleID=483\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Tzomet</a> is an Israeli group of rabbis, researchers and engineers\nthat study new technology in relation to <em>halacha</em>.

If the\n  \"result\" is what is important, all types of shavers would be\n  prohibited for use, since none of the shavers leaves hair that can be\n  pulled or that can be felt with the hand.</p>\n  \n  <p>However, the question of whether shavers can be used is based on the\n  definition of \"scissors that are like a razor\" and this depends on the\n  mode of operation and not on the result. If the cutting is performed\n  by two or more edges coming into contact, the machine is defined as\n  scissors and not as a razor.</p>\n  \n  <p>In all the electric shavers, the cutting process is one of contact\n  between a moving blade and the head (a metal screen). Thus, from the\n  point of view of the action performed, these machines are scissors.\n  And this is the basis of our current position.</p>\n  \n  <p><strong>In our opinion, almost every type of electric shaver which operates as\n  described above can be used.</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

Regardless, isn't preserving ones own life paramount (except in 3 areas where one should die, like idolatry, etc.)? One can override any commandment to preserve one's life. Tamar was possibly falsely accused of being a harlot (my question on whether her being pregnant by her father-in-law is considered harlotry or <em>zonah</em>). Even if not, refer to Rash\"i and <em>Siftei Chachamim</em> that question if she should have been sentenced to burning as she was neither engaged nor married.</p>\n\n<p>In short, I don't see how Tamar's actions is an example of that principle.

The simple approach is that it isn't. Rambam, for example, doesn't mention this teaching at all. Apparently, like Meiri in Sotah there (see <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/a/53643/8775\">here</a>), he thought that this was just a dramatic exaggeration; not a halakha (or less likely, that it is a halakha and isn't normative). </p>\n\n<p>Regarding why it would be omitted from the classical listings of just three, Tosafot (who apparently understands it to be an actual halakha) in Sotah (10b s.v. noah lo l'adam) writes that it is mentioned since listed together with the other three, since it isn't explicit in the Torah. (Not that the other ones are exactly explicit, but this isn't the place to discuss the problems with Tosafot.)</p>\n\n<p>Alternatively, Rabbenu Yonah suggests in Sha'arei Teshuva (3:139) that shaming a person is akin to killing him. (Although it isn't completely clear that he accepts this as binding halakha; he us just explaining the statement regardles of whether it is literal or not, and regardless of whether halakha follows it.)</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: -1)\n\n<p>First we'll bring the exact language of the Sages (Berachot 43b, BM 59a, Soyto 10) \"<strong>It is convenient for a person to</strong> jump into a fiery oven rather than embarrass someone in public\" (\"נח לו לאדם שיפיל את עצמו לכבשן האש ואל ילבין פני חבירו ברבים\"). The bold part is very important as it makes it clear that this saying is not about an obligation to kill oneself to prevent embarrassment of others, but rather defining it as a <strong>a figurative conduct</strong>, on par with comparing anger to idolatry and more. This is not a \"mandatory behavior\" like Yehareg vaAl Yaavor, it only means \"one should value somebody else's embarrassment as a matter of life and death\".</p>\n\n<p>Based on this interpretation, we can say that since there's no obligation, and there's no \"Yehareg vaAl Yaavor\", you are absolutely right, that one who kills himself in this situation would be a sinner, according to Rambam in <a href=\"http://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/904980/jewish/Yesodei-haTorah-Chapter-Five.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Yesodei-haTorah</a></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>\"If anyone about whom it is said: \"Transgress and do not sacrifice your life,\" sacrifices his life and does not transgress, he is held accountable for his life.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

Easy, he went home and brought a ladder!</em></p>\n\n<p>We need to keep this story in mind when we read commentaries or try to explain different Torah stories ourselves - <strong>we expect it to be consistent</strong>. Unfortunately, we don't have a tradition of the necessity of consistency, so commentators use an arbitrary number of Talmud rulings to bring an excuse. \nSo I came up with two explanations that are consistent with what we know from the Jewish Halakha:</p>\n\n<h2>Option A: There's no justification - they sinned.</h2>\n\n<ul>\n<li>You are absolutely right, there's no justification. The only option of selling a Jew is by overriding the \"Le Tignov\" option (of the 10 commandments), which is a capital sin by itself. The death of the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ten_Martyrs\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Ten Martyrs</a> is closely linked to repaying their misdeed, proving this theory. But the Halachah only allows selling a Jew to another Jew, not to a non-Jew.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>Option B: Before Matan Torah, they could do whatever they pleased.</h2>\n\n<ul>\n<li>This option is also vital, as their Halakhic status is not clearly decided upon (<em>Gemorah in ?</em>). We know that they were not exactly gentiles, and not exactly Jews, so they could use any Halakhic system of their own (theoretically).</li>\n<li>It does not say they did not know \"Torah\" but they could override it in any way possible, <strong>because of their spiritual level</strong>, like marrying two sisters (Yaakov), marrying a Canaanite (Judah), judge their relatives (Judah with Tamar or Brothers), having an \"affair with a married gentile woman\" (Yosef) etc.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>Option C: The whole story is metaphoric.</h2>\n\n<ul>\n<li>I know for many of us this is not an option, that's why I said \"two\". But for some interpreters (Abraham Ben HaRambam? source needed) it is. Many books of \"Kabbalic\" approach from Ariz\"l to Baash\"t and further explain the story from Sefirot/Bechinot point of view.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>I would also like to broaden the question, taking into consideration their background (we know very little of):</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>How did Yaakov educate his children? </li>\n<li>Yaakov knew first-handed how the brothers' hatred feels like, what did he learn from it and what did he pass to the Tribes?</li>\n<li>He prophesied there should be 12 tribes of Israel. How is this possible by killing one?</li>\n<li>What did their Zeide (Izhok) think about the whole story?</li>\n<li>Yosef befriended his \"half-slave\" brothers. How come they did not stand up for him?</li>\n<li>(My favored) Besides the Halahka, which is questionable, how come nobody simply doubted and consulted either Hashem or Yaakov or Yizhok or \"Shem vaEver's shul\"?</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n",

So i'm confused, the two things I heard sound contradictory to me</p>\n\n<p>What is correct?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>Perhaps the reason you heard that rabbis began after the Second Temple, is that that is when the term 'rabbi' is introduced. For example, earlier Sages listed chronologically in Avot (1:2-12) are not called rabbi. These include:  Shim'on HaTsadik, Antignos Ish Sokho, Yossi ben Yoezer, Yossi ben Yohanan, Yehoshua ben Perachya, Nittai HaArbeli, Yehuda ben Tabbai, Shimon ben Shetah, Sh'maya, Avtalyon, Hillel, and Shammai.[i] The first one in the list with a 'rabbi' based title, is Rabban Gamliel who indeed lived in the first century, the century of the Second Temple's destruction.</p>\n\n<p>Alternatively, perhaps what you heard was part of a general doubting of the existence of a rabbinic culture in Second Temple times, given the seeming explosion of rabbinic literature and activity at the end of the Second Temple Era.</p>\n\n<p>The traditional approach eschews this approach, and portrays a line of rabbis (although not called rabbis) from Moses to the Sages of the Mishna. The first chapter of Avot (referenced above) is one rabbinic source regarding the transmission of the Torah knowledge through the Second Temple era.</p>\n\n<p>This is consistent with the Talmud's story (Avodah Zara 8b) about R. Yehuda ben Bava continuing the line of formal ordination in the early second century CE.</p>\n\n<p>For a historian's take on the history of rabbinic culture in the Second Temple Era, see <a href=\"http://lawrenceschiffman.com/second-temple-and-rabbinic-judaism.PDF\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><em>Second Temple and Rabbinic Judaism</em></a>, by the eminent historian  <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawrence_Schiffman\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Prof. Lawrence Schiffman</a>, who notes (page 8) that:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The Pharisees cannot have emerged suddenly, full-blown in the Hasmonian period. Their theology and organization must have been in formation somewhat earlier. How much earlier, we cannot say.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hasmonean_dynasty\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Hasmonian Period</a> was the second century BCE. This is at least a couple of centuries before the destruction of the Second Temple.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>[i] I am aware that in later editions scribes sometimes added rabbinic appellations to these figures, but it is clear that these are later additions.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>The correct record of how the Romans attempted to break the chain of rabbinic ordination and how the rabbis had it reinstituted is brought in BT (<a href=\"https://halakhah.com/zarah/zarah_8.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">A.Z. 8b</a>). Soncino trans.:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Forty years before the Temple was destroyed did the Sanhedrin abandon [the Temple] and held its sittings in Hanuth... Has not Rab Judah said [the following] in the name of Rab: Verily that man, R. Judah b. Baba by name, be remembered for good, for were it not for him the laws of fine would have been forgotten in Israel? 'Forgotten'! Surely, they could be studied? — Nay, they would have been abolished; for the wicked Government of Rome issued a decree that he who ordains a Rabbi shall be slain, likewise he who is ordained shall be put to death, the town in which an ordination takes place shall be destroyed and the tehum in which the ordination is held shall be laid waste. What did R. Judah b. Baba do? He went and sat down between two mountains and between two large towns between two tehums, namely, between Usha and Shefar'am and there he ordained five elders: R. Meir, R. Judah [b. Il'ai]. R. Jose, R. Simeon and R. Eleazar b. Shammua (R. Awia adds also R. Nehemiah). </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# How can Hashem judge a person לזכות, favourably, as in הדן חבירו לכף זכות דנין אותו לזכות\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>The Gemoro <a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/shas.aspx?mesechta=2&daf=127b&format=text\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Shabbos 127b</a> brings three stories illustrating the principle,</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>הדן חבירו לכף זכות דנין אותו לזכות  </p>\n  \n  <p>“He who judges his neighbour in the scale of merit is himself judged\n  favourably.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The stories show how one person (Reuven) took certain actions which could be interpreted well or badly by another (Shimon). Shimon, despite his personal disadvantage, interpreted the actions in a positive light. Reuven blessed Shimon that just as Shimon judged him favourably, so G-d should judge Shimon favourably. </p>\n\n<p>The problem is that in the stories, Shimon did not know the truth and made a decision that Reuven had acted well. When G-d judges, He knows all the truth, so how can it be that He can judge Shimon favourably?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>One simple answer is that there is a difference between לכף זכות, and דנין אותו לזכות. danin לכף זכות alludes to a scale of justice tilting uncertainly (cf. Bertenura  to Avot 1:6). One should judge favourably in cases of uncertainty. דנין לזכות, however, need not mean that God is uncertain, and rules favourably. Rather it can simply mean, that God rules favourably for whatever reason (including, in our case, the mitigating factor of the subject's own favourable evaluation of others). The term זכות, after all just means benefit, as for example in the expression זכין לאדם שלא בפניו (Eruvin 7:11). Accordingly, דנין אותו לזכות, could just mean to render a beneficial ruling about the person.</p>\n\n<p>This is stated explicitly by the Meiri in Chibur Hateshuva (Meishiv Nefesh 1:4 pp. 90-1 in ed. Mirsky) who writes:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>וכן תמצא ר' יהושע ע\"ה העידו עליו ואמרו ז\"ל (שבת קכז)... אמר להם העבודה כך היה ואתם שדנתוני לזכות המקום ידין אתכם לזכות כלומר...יגמלכם הגומל כפי הראוי לכם והוא אמרו המקום ידין אתכם לזכות ולא אמר לכף זכות כי לא יתכן העלמות ענין אצלו ית' ‏</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>I heard the following in a shiur from Rabbi Rosner, quoting Reb Yisroel Salanter ztz”l. </p>\n\n<p>“After 120 years” a person will come to their judgement in heaven. The person will be shown their life in such a way as the occurrences will be theirs but they will not be able to recognise themselves or the other people depicted. </p>\n\n<p>On each decision point, the person will be asked to judge whether he acted rightly or otherwise. His judgements will form the Divine judgement on that person. Thus, if they accustomed themself to judge “lekaf zechus”, their judgement will be “lekaf zechus”!</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>Your good question tries to question the very basis of the days of repentance and Yom Kippur, which is \"influencing G-d (and/or Heavenly court) <strong>to skew</strong> the final verdict\". We keep saying \"don't look at that\", \"don't judge that\", \"skip over the first sin, and then again\", etc.</p>\n\n<p>THe whole aforementioned concept is rooted in the Gemmorah that you cite, which follows the idea of anthropomorphic (human-like) G-d against the concept of omniscient, deterministic G-d that Rambam describes in Yesodot Hatora - G-d that has no change and can't be changed and that you try to compare to in your question.</p>\n\n<p>(Personally I believe the two are incompatible and that's the reason for Ashkenazi Rabbis burning Rambam's books), but trying to reconcile the two in Rambam's eyes I could say, that the saying is purely motivational - <em>you're motivated to think</em> positively about others' intentions and imaging (even wrongfully) that G-d might change His judgment about you.</p>\n\n\n",

This lesson went on to explain that because everything is G-d's will that the man who cause you harm is like the stick. He would not be able to harm you if it was not G-d's will. Though the culprit has freewill and is responsible, anger at what happen to you is substituting your will for that of G-d and thus a form of idol worship.

In chapter 12 the Egyptians urge them to leave quickly, and that's when the borrowing occurs. </p>\n\n<p>How isolated or how intermingled were Israel and the Egyptians at the time of the exodus?  Did Israel have Egyptian neighbors, or did they actually borrow silver and gold from random Egyptians they encountered on the way out that night?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>The Netziv in Ha'amek Dovor on Shemos 1-7 (<a href=\"http://beta.hebrewbooks.org/reader/reader.aspx?sfid=40080#p=9&fitMode=fitheight&hlts=&ocr=\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">http://beta.hebrewbooks.org/reader/reader.aspx?sfid=40080#p=9&fitMode=fitheight&hlts=&ocr=</a>) writes that when the people multiplied many of them moved out of Goshen into Mitzrayim proper. The proof for that is of course that HaShem had to \"pass over\" the houses of the Jewish people when killing the Egyptian first-born. If the Jewish people would all still have lived in Goshen, that wouldn't have been necessary. The Ibn Ezra actually writes the same.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>My view is that the non-Jewish neighbors were within walking distance but did not share wells, fields, gardens, pastures, etc.  In addition to the gathering of metals and jewels, they had to be reasonably close with their neighbors because: </p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>There was intermarriage.</li>\n<li>The Erev rav joined them in the hours after the 10th plague and before they left the next morning.  Even if these were only family members of those who intermarried, they had to have enough time to figure out what was happening and prepare to leave (which can be quick but requires travel both ways).</li>\n<li>Moses and Aaron travelled multiple times to the palace to meet with Pharaoh.  They probably traveled by boat (which was common in that era) which is quicker that walking or on a pack animal (or even a horse, if they were available to them, which is unlikely).  We don't know how long this journey took but the text indicates new locations \"the following day.\"  If the palace* was less than a day's journey, other slave villages, regular workers, and others wouldn't be too far.  They also talk about going out of the city, which implies the palace is inside the city, and not next to the edge.</li>\n<li>There is talk of trade.  Purchasing the lamb for Passover, for example.  This could be a purchase from other Jews, but it implies there is trade among neighbors.</li>\n<li>Their main work is to make bricks and to tend Pharaoh's fields.  This work is commute distance from their villages and the output of that work would need to be easily transportable to the city and elsewhere (both are done by the river).</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>I imagine the edge of the Hebrew villages to be not far from the part of the river with the brickyard, as well as various fields.  Down river (north/northeast) would be the city and palace.  Back behind, around, and in-between the villages would be the undamaged gardens belonging to the Hebrews, as well as their pastures and livestock.  </p>\n\n<p>There would also be other villages for slaves and/or workers and the Hebrews would have interacted to some degree with them.  It is also possible that the brickmaking and fieldwork was shared.  The Hebrews had their own quotas but that doesn't mean the entire brickyard was only them.

Next to the river would be fields all the way up to Nubia and beyond (\"up\" in Egypt means against the flow of the river, which flows from south to north).

Yaakov Avinu askes Yosef to go to Shechem to locate \" the brothers\". \"The brothers\" are not in Shechem, rather they are in Dosan. By going there, he was susceptible to harm. </p>\n\n<p>So if Yosef does a little bit more for his father, he's no longer under the protection of Kibbud av? </p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 4)\n\n<p><a href=\"https://torah.org/torah-portion/ravfrand-5778-vayeishev/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rabbi Frand</a> deals with this question. The Ohr HaChaim asks the question</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The Ohr HaChaim asks — how could this happen?  There is a principle\n  “Harm does not come to those sent on a mission to do a mitzvah”\n  (shiluchei mitzvah einan nizokin) [Pesachim 8a]? What happened to the\n  rule of shiluchei mitzvah einan nizokin when Yosef carried out his\n  father’s instructions?</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>There are two answers given to this question. One answer is based on the idea that Yosef was sent to Shechem to find his brothers. However, he decided to go to Dosan since they were not at Shechem. That is, the mission was to go to Shechem and see what was going on. If the brothers were no longer in Shechem then he should have returned home to report. As a result he was no longer a shaliach when he continued on to Dosan. This answer is rejected because of the following halacha.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>(The HaMakneh (by Rav Pinchas haLevi Horowitz [1731-1805] in Maseches\n  Kiddushin asks on this answer of the Ohr HaChaim, and says that this\n  argument is not based on normative halachic ruling. The Halacha is\n  that if a person says to an agent “Give this Get [divorce document] to\n  my wife in Shechem” and he gives it to her in a different city, the\n  Get is invalid (because the agent did not carry out the instructions\n  of the husband).  However, if the husband says to the agent, “Give\n  this Get to my wife – “she can be found in Shechem” — then even if the\n  agent finds her in a different city and gives her the divorce document\n  there, it is valid.  We say that when the husband specifies, “she can\n  be found in Shechem” — he is merely helping the agent find his wife\n  (mar’eh makom hu lah), rather than insisting that the divorce be\n  carried out in a specific location.  Thus, the HaMakneh rejects the\n  first answer of the Ohr HaChaim.)</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The second answer is based on the fact that Yosef, and his entire family (including Yaakov and his brothers) were actually going to be helped by this turn of events.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The Ohr HaChaim gives a second answer to his question, in which he\n  redefines the definition of “harm” [nezek]</p>\n  \n  <p>“Harm whose ultimate purpose is good, is not considered harm.” \n  Ultimately, what happened to Yosef was not a bad thing. Shiluchei\n  Mitzvah einan nizokin means no bad will befall an agent of mitzvah. \n  This was not bad because this mission led to Yosef’s winding up in\n  Egypt, and ultimately saving the world!  Admittedly, he went through\n  some difficulties to get there, but the bottom line was that the\n  result was not only salvation for his family, but also salvation for\n  the entire world.  Such “trouble” from which great salvation emerges,\n  is not considered “nezek.”</p>\n  \n  <p>This idea espouses a very important truth that is not always easy to\n  realize or accept. Many times, people experience tremendous\n  challenges, certain that they are experiencing tragic misfortune, yet\n  the challenges eventually turn out not to be misfortune at all, but\n  rather a true salvation.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Indeed, why did Yaakov Avinu send Yosef to his brothers when he knew how they felt. He knew that the brothers were watching the sheep in Shechem. He knew that the shepherds and other servants were there and that it was a good sized town. As a result the brothers would not have harmed Yosef. Rav Hirsch points out that it also tested Yosef to see his attitude towards his brothers. Yosef passed the test by going. The brothers were not in Shechem so Yosef would not have found them (and he would have returned to his father saying that they were not in Shechem) had he not stumbled on a stranger (the malach Gavriel) who had <em>happened</em> to overhear them saying that they were going to Dosan. This is an example of how Hashem twists matters so that they come out the way He wants no matter what plans a man may make.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.chabad.org/library/bible_cdo/aid/8232#v=15&showrashi=true\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Vayeishev 37:15</a> Rav Hirsch uses the term <em>blundering</em>.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Then a man found him, and behold, he was straying in the field, and\n  the man asked him, saying, \"What are you looking for?\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>We see then that Yosef would not have found his brothers at all had Hashem not decided that this is what needed to be done to save the Bnai Yisrael.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: -1)\n\n<p>If you were asking your question from a better source in Gemmorah (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Kiddushin.39b.12?lang=he&with=all&lang2=he\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Kiddushin 39</a>) which speaks of one who did Kibbud Av and tragically died, you would immediately get to the Torah Temimah's answer:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"והא אמר רבי אלעזר שלוחי מצוה אינן נזוקין לא בהליכתן ולא בחזירתן סולם רעוע הוה דקביע היזיקא <strong>וכל היכא דקביע היזיקא לא סמכינן אניסא</strong> דכתיב (שמואל א טז, ב) ויאמר שמואל איך אלך ושמע שאול והרגני \"</p>\n<p>\"But didn’t Rabbi Elazar say that those on the path to perform a mitzva are not susceptible to harm, neither when they are on their way to perform the mitzva nor when they are returning from performing the mitzva? The Gemara answers: In that case it was a rickety ladder, <strong>and therefore the danger was established; and anywhere that the danger is established one may not rely on a miracle.</strong>\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>As Shechem (and the whole area) was the [well-known] dangerous place, Kibbud-Av could not save him miraculously.</p>\n\n\n",

On the other hand, we also see מות=death as a ב־ object in Ezekiel 18:23,32; 33:11. And, indeed, most objects of חפץ generally use ב־.

The reason is so that our minds should be clear to be able to concentrate on tefillah.</p>\n\n<p>Granted, the definition of \"learning Torah\" (i.e to what level), is discussed by the Poskim and it seems that, broadly speaking, \"light\" learning (learning that is not too involved - see the sources brought above that use the language of \"שאין בה עיון\") is ok and \"heavy\" learning is not.</p>\n\n<p>My question is this: In all Yeshivos that I have studied at (and I'm sure this applies to many, many others) they daven Mincha immediately after the morning shiur (or morning seder). Surely morning seder, an iyun seder in most Yeshivos, should certainly qualify as Torah learning that is involving and distracting from Tefillah. What is the rationale behind this schedule?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>Perhaps this is the lesser of evils. Let us look at the Talmudic source.</p>\n\n<p><strong><a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/shas.aspx?mesechta=1&daf=31&format=pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Berachos 31a</a></strong></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>ת\"ר אין עומדין להתפלל לא מתוך דין ולא מתוך דבר הלכה אלא מתוך הלכה\n  פסוקה והיכי דמי הלכה פסוקה אמר אביי כי הא דר' זירא דאמר ר' זירא בנות\n  ישראל החמירו על עצמן שאפילו רואות טיפת דם כחרדל יושבת עליה שבעה נקיים\n  רבא אמר כי הא דרב הושעיא דאמר רב הושעיא מערים אדם על תבואתו ומכניסה\n  במוץ שלה כדי שתהא בהמתו אוכלת ופטורה מן המעשר ואב\"א כי הא דרב הונא\n  דא\"ר הונא א\"ר זעירא המקיז דם בבהמת קדשים אסור בהנאה ומועלין בו רבנן\n  עבדי כמתניתין רב אשי עביד כברייתא: ת\"ר אין עומדין להתפלל לא מתוך עצבות\n  ולא מתוך עצלות ולא מתוך שחוק ולא מתוך שיחה ולא מתוך קלות ראש ולא מתוך\n  דברים בטלים אלא מתוך שמחה של מצוה</p>\n  \n  <p>Our Rabbis taught: A man should not stand up to say Tefillah either\n  immediately after trying a case or immediately after a [discussion on\n  a point of] halachah; but he may do so after a halachic decision which\n  admits of no discussion. What is an example of a halachic decision\n  which admits of no discussion? — Abaye said: Such a one as the\n  following of R. Zera; for R. Zera said: The daughters of Israel have\n  undertaken to be so strict with themselves that if they see a drop of\n  blood no bigger than a mustard seed they wait seven [clean] days after\n  it. Raba said: A man may resort to a device with his produce and bring\n  it into the house while still in its chaff so that his animal may eat\n  of it without its being liable to tithe. Or, if you like, I can say,\n  such as the following of R. Huna. For R. Huna said in the name of R.\n  Zeiri: If a man lets blood in a consecrated animal, no benefit may he\n  derived from it [the blood] and such benefit constitutes a trespass.\n  The Rabbis followed the rule laid down in the Mishnah, R. Ashi that of\n  the Baraitha.</p>\n  \n  <p>Our Rabbis taught: One should not stand up to say Tefillah while\n  immersed in sorrow, or idleness, or laughter, or chatter, or\n  frivolity, or idle talk, but only while still rejoicing in the\n  performance of some religious act. (<a href=\"https://halakhah.com/pdf/zeraim/Berachoth.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Soncino translation</a>)</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>As we can see, the very same Talmudic passage that prohibits praying amid studying Torah also prohibits praying amid sorrow, idleness, laughter, chatter, frivolity, or idle talk. If the yeshivot force the students to take a break from learning before praying, the good students will end up praying amid sorrow (for they had to abandon the joyful Torah study) and the bad students will end up praying amid idleness, laughter, chatter, frivolity, or idle talk. Therefore it is probably better to just allow them to pray amid Torah study.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>The halacha in o.c. 89'6' is that one may not start learning once the time for tefilah arrived. If one began learning even after the zeman arrived nevertheless he may continue before his recital of the shmonah esrei. If someone began his learning bofore the time came there is surely no problem and one may begin his learning even when knowing that he shall still be learning when the time arrives.</p>\n\n<p>Since we established that one may begin learning before the arrival of the zeman to pray, we may reason, if the isur of learning prior to prayers which is the care and foresight not to miss out the prayers yields itself for the learning allowing one to learn and go into the time of prayers, then surely the halacha of iyun prior to prayer which is a kavana issue and enhancer shall yield for the one begining to learn before prayer time.  </p>\n\n<p>This being the case it is no question that one may begin his yeshiva learning before the time for mincha came about or even before you are in close proximity to the yeshiva's mincha. </p>\n\n<p>(See the Mogen Avraham 93'3' that says  that although one may not learn iyun before tefila if he began and the tsibur is starting the tefila he may stop and daven with them as it is lechatchila only.)</p>\n\n<p>In conclusion, this was a beautiful point brought up and along side that the answer is clear and unequivocal and the yeshivot may continue and maintain their tradition(merely calling it a tradition being that a custom in yeshivot may have significant rationale being astablished by great people), having the mincha after the morning learning.</p>\n\n\n",

(As in, it only became popular since the founding of the State of Israel.) German communities have sung Tehillim 128 after the Kiddushin but before the breaking of the glass for centuries. We use the same tune as when we sing it Motzei Shabbos. It is either sung by 1, 3, or a group of individuals. (I have never heard of it being sung by the bride and groom themselves or by everyone around the Chuppah.)</p>\n\n<p>As for why that specific Psalm - Google the translation. It is very apropos for a wedding (\"Your wife will be as a fruitful vine\", \"may you see children [born] to your children\").</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.chabad.org/library/bible_cdo/aid/16349/jewish/Chapter-128.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">http://www.chabad.org/library/bible_cdo/aid/16349/jewish/Chapter-128.htm</a></p>\n\n<p>Source: I am a Yekke.

(<em>No need to discuss it here, it is only an assumption, it does not relate to the question</em>).</li>\n<li>Yaakov meets Rachel and \"falls in love\".</li>\n<li>Yaakov offers Lavan to work 7 years (to pay) for Rachel.</li>\n<li>Yaakov finishes working 7 years and demands Lavan to bring his <strong>wife</strong> to fulfill the Mitzvah of Pru uRvu (to establish the 12 Tribes).<br>\n<code>\"Give me my wife, **for my days are filled**, that I may go in unto her\"</code> (Ber 29,21)</li>\n<li>Lavan throws a feast and disguises Leah as Rachel.</li>\n<li>Yaakov sleeps with Leah.</li>\n<li>Yaakov demands to have Rachel and Lavan offers him to wait one week to have Rachel also.</li>\n<li>Lavan gives Rachel to Yaakov.</li>\n<li>Yaakov works 7 additional years.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>According to Jewish Halakha this order rises legitimate questions:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>According to Seder Olam, Rachel and Leah were grown up (21yo) and did not need their fathers agreement and power to marry as underaged girls. Yaakov could marry them both on the spot with two witnesses only by dancing before them or by writing a Shtar. No money needed. He was also old and pressed to establish the tribes, so in fact he could do it 7 years earlier.</li>\n<li>If we assume that the wage of the 7 years Yaakov worked were meant for Rachel's Kiddushin for Lavan, she was his rightful wife on the last day's sundown as he demanded from Lavan to bring his <strong>wife</strong> not fiancee. So Rachel was already his wife before the wedding night.</li>\n<li>Leah was not Mekudeshet in any way in the whole story, not bought and not even by Bieh, as none explicitly meant it. It was seemingly a mere Beilas Znus.</li>\n<li>There was no need to ask Lavan's permission again to have Rachel as explained above.</li>\n<li>What were the additional 7 years of work for?</li>\n</ol>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>just an answer to number three. The fact that is was Beilas Znus was according the Ohr Hachaim (Breishis 29:23) one of the thing he was upset about. According the both the ohr hachaim and the malbim the only way Yakov could have legally married either sister was with Biah (hence the term ואבוא אליה). The second time Yakov was with Leah when he was aware she was Leah is when Yaakov halachically married Leah</p>\n\n\n",

Because they didn't all enter in one gate, Yosef accused them of being spies. So, I understand how he arrives at his accusation.</p>\n\n<p>But, in reading the commentaries, I'm not seeing anything that explains the connection of bringing down their other brother absolves them of the spy accusation.</p>\n\n<p>In light of @robev's comment, I'm adding some extra clarification of a nuance I see in various verses. I originally concentrated on <a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=9597&st=&pgnum=550&hilite=\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Bereishit 42:16</a> where Yosef says that he will test to see if what the brothers said -  namely, that they were all brothers of the same family and all they did was come to buy food - was true. If they couldn't do that, then they were spies.</p>\n\n<p>However, when the brothers relay the story to Ya'akov in <a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=9597&st=&pgnum=554\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">verse 34</a> they say that Yosef said, \"In this way I will know that <strong>you are not spies</strong>, but you are honest people.\"</p>\n\n<p>There's a bit of a nuance I see in this second verse. To me, it implies not just proving that they were correct in their claim, but they also had to prove that Yosef's claim that they were spies was wrong.</p>\n\n<p>Thus, in providing defense to the accusation, they may have had to do both according to Yosef's demand, (in most U.S. court cases, (and perhaps, in halacha, as well) as I understand, when the defense provides proof that his claim is right, it doesn't necessarily counter the accusation, and it may not be a defense at all.) or, to my original claim, that the proof of their original claim that they were brothers of one family <strong>contradicted</strong> Yosef's claim.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>Until about 200 years ago (around the time of the founding of the United states) most of the world had barbaric laws which were twisted and favoured those with power. Thank G-d we have grown up unaware of this in 1st world modern day society. It says Earlier in Bereishit 12,15 that Pharoh kidnapped Avrahams wife Sarah, so Egypt wasn't exactly \"just\" rather corruption was the norm.</p>\n\n<p>The brothers were just trying to get food, so that meant doing whatever Yosef wanted corrupt or not, so they'd Bring Binyomin, it was Pikuach Nefesh. They thought Yosef was illegitimately framing them  Bereishis 42,30: דבר האיש אדני הארץ אתנו קשות ויתן אתנו כמרגלים את הארץ that the brothers recounted to Yaakov how Yosef spoke harshly to them as if they were spies (and we weren't). </p>\n\n<p>This is what the Ramban explais Bereishit 42,9 was Yosefs agenda:                        </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>בראות יוסף את אחיו משתחוים לו זכר כל החלומות אשר חלם להם וידע שלא נתקיים אחד מהם בפעם הזאת כי יודע בפתרונם כי כל אחיו ישתחוו לו בתחילה מן החלום הראשון והנה אנחנו מאלמים אלומים כי \"אנחנו\" ירמוז לכל אחיו אחד עשר ופעם שנית ישתחוו לו השמש והירח ואחד עשר כוכבים מן החלום השני וכיון שלא ראה בנימן עמהם חשב זאת התחבולה שיעליל עליהם כדי שיביאו גם בנימין אחיו אליו לקיים החלום הראשון תחילה ועל כן לא רצה להגיד להם אני יוסף אחיכם ולאמר מהרו ועלו אל אבי וישלח העגלות כאשר עשה עמהם בפעם השניה כי היה אביו בא מיד בלא ספק ואחרי שנתקיים החלום הראשון הגיד להם לקיים החלום השני ולולי כן היה יוסף חוטא חטא גדול לצער את אביו ולהעמידו ימים רבים בשכול </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Basically Yosef had an agenda to fulfill his dream which was a prophecy that all his brothers should bow down to him like the first dream of the 11 sheaves. Therefore he made up an excuse in order for Binyomin to come and bow down which he did in 43,26 along with all the brothers.<br>\nHe then detained Binyomin and did not reveal himself straight away in order to eventually Bring Yaakov to bow down to him like the second dream of the Sun Moon and Stars which were his father mother and 11 brothers bowing down to him. This didn't quite work as he revealed himself prematurely, but Yaakov eventually did in Bereishis 47,31 willingly.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>The Malbim 42:16 explains that initially Yosef wanted all the brothers to stay and when he says \"send one from you ,and he will bring your brother \". He meant that they wpuld send a messenger with a document asking Binyamin to come down,this would definitively prove that they weren't spies,since the brother wpuld not have any interaction with him. </p>\n\n<p>However the Malbim notes that Yosef put them into custody for 3 days since they would not submit to Yosefs test. So Yosef gives another option to save their lives . They would have to leave one of the \"brothers\" to see if they indeed are brothers ,if they aren't brothers then the others would jusy leave and never come back,but if they are truly brothers they will come back for their brother. </p>\n\n<p>So the Malbim is saying that Yosef is trying to corroborate the words of the brothers to see if they are indeed brothers ,to prove defentitlvy that they are spies using his first test idea of holding all brothers he was not able to do based off the belief in God,he would not hold them against their will. So with the second test at least he will be able to prove that at least they are brothers.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: -1)\n\n<p>In addition to the other excellent answers, Yosef would also be motivated to know if these were the same men who sold him into slavery out of envy.</p>\n\n<p>Knowing that at this point his youngest full brother would most likely be the favorite of their father, he shows great favor to that one (with a greater portion of food at dinner) and sees no jealousy, and then puts that same one into danger (the well-known frame-up) to see if they will stick their necks out for him or throw him under the bus.</p>\n\n<p>Once they have passed these tests, Yosef knew that they had changed for the better, and makes himself known to them.</p>\n\n\n",

For example on September 1st when wearing Star of David was made mandatory.</p>\n\n<p>Is that way of showing support actually okay or considered (religiously) inappropriate?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>Thank you for your question.</p>\n\n<p>One thing you have to ask yourself is, when you go out wearing your kippah on certain days, do people see you and remember that today's date is associated with the Holocaust, or do they think that you're Jewish and out enjoying the day? </p>\n\n<p>I don't think there's anything religiously inappropriate about wearing your kippah. As <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/users/5275/danf\">DanF</a> pointed out in the comments, the basic design and idea of the kippah is found in many other world religions and cultures besides Judaism. Jewish Law mandates that we should keep our heads covered, but does not specify with what. In Judaism, a kippah has become a very traditional way of covering the head but a baseball cap or other hat works just as well. </p>\n\n<p>Back to my second paragraph, the one about what people think when they see you. If you want to remind people that today's date is significant in regards to the Holocaust, then maybe wearing a kippah isn't the best way of doing that. You might think of other things to do, perhaps in addition to wearing your kippah which would illustrate that better than simply wearing a kippah.</p>\n\n<p>I hope this answer helps.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: -2)\n\n<p>Here are some religious considerations of mine regarding your question:</p>\n\n<p>Why connect your support to the holocaust and not do it all year long? Is it because you hold your nation responsible? This attitude might not be relevant today, two - three generations after the war. As such it may lead to a totally different response, triggering an anger and hatred toward you AND Jewish people, which is bad for Jews and is definitely forbidden.</p>\n\n<p>Another reason to refrain from this ritual is that you can be mistaken for a Jew, with some consequences, i.e. counted for a Minyan, or be revealed a secret, which is also forbidden. I had a situation once when a very Jewish-looking old guy with his wife entered a synagogue in Jerusalem and I volunteered to help them around. We befriended and they started to attend my lectures. We talked a lot and one day it turned out he's not circumcised. I arranged a Bris with \"Bris Itzhok\" and everything was ready when he admitted he wasn't Jewish, he only wanted to express his closeness and interest in Judaism.</p>\n\n<p>In addition, you might want to consider supporting the Jews practically, either by donating or volunteering - this is far more important religiously and will get you more rewards than dressing like a religious Jew. This will surely answer your needs without the negative side-effects.</p>\n\n\n",

I did not receive an answer.</p>\n\n<p>You are absolutely right, noticing, that the Torah does not order the Mitzvot by value (as in Avot \"אי אתה יודע שכרן של מצוות\") and the Sages usually only emphasize a single Mitzva (Shabbat, studying, Gma\"H, and same for negative Mitzvot - mkurder, idolatry, Z\"l etc) instead of building a clear hierarchy. This was a real mystery for me until I met my Rabbi some 10 years later. Now I know two ways to resolve this contradiction:</p>\n\n<h2>1. Litvakes vs Chassidishers approach</h2>\n\n<p>The difference in the two approaches comes from what Rashi (based on ויק\"ר ל\"ו) brings on the first word in the Torah \"בשביל תורה שנקראת ראשית ובשביל ישראל שנקראו ראשית\". Those are the two complementary purposes of this world - one is the goal of learning the Torah and the second of \"becoming a good Jew\" so to speak. Traditionally, despite of many rabbinical stories, the first approach took precedence, implying that studying Torah will ultimately lead to the second goal also. This is the Litvakes approach, currently de-facto standard of the Orthodox Judaism. Important to note, that the highest rank here would be a Gaon, that know all the Torah by heart.</p>\n\n<p>The Chassidishers approach is based on the Mishna in Berachot (5, 1) \"חסידים הראשונים היו שוהין שעה אחת\", so the Gemorah asks about spending 9 hours a day in prayers - and it seems to be fine with this way of serving Hashem. Indeed, the Chassidut (based on the Talmud and then AriZ\"l and then Baash\"t) sees any Mitzvah being properly intended and fulfilled as a legitimate way of connecting to Hashem.

    "content": "# Lighting Hanukkah Candles Alone\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>If a person lived alone in an apartment, would it be okay to make the brakhot when lighting Hanukkah candles, even though there are no other members of the household to see the lights, and therefore no implementation of <em>pirsumei nisa</em> / publicizing the miracle?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 10)\n\n<p>The Shulchan Aruch in O.C. 677:3 writes:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>יש אומרים שאע\"ג שמדליקין עליו בתוך ביתו, אם הוא במקום שאין בו ישראל מדליק בברכות</p>\n<p>Some say that even though they are lighting for a person at his home, if he is in a place where there are no Jews he should light with the blessings.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The Rema adds</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>וכן נוהגין</p>\n<p>And this is our practice.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This is a person who is alone without any other Jews, family or non-family, and yet they light with the blessings. This seemingly demonstrates that the <em>mitzvah</em> can be performed with the blessings even without the <em>pirsumei nisa</em> to others.</p>\n<p>(Although the Mishneh Berura #14 points out that this is a contradiction to what the Shulchan Aruch writes in 676:3, that is only regarding that which one makes a blessing even though his wife/family is lighting for him.)</p>\n<p>However, the rationale for such a person lighting is, as the Rema writes at the beginning of his gloss,</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>כי חיב לראות הנרות</p>\n<p>because he is obligated to see [Chanukah] candles.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>That being the case, in the case that a person happens to not have anyone else who will witness his light, but he could walk out on the street and see the lights of other Jews, they would have no reason to specifically light. Nonetheless, the Rema continues that</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>אפילו אם הוא אצל יהודים ורואה הנרות, אם רוצה להחמיר על עצמו ולהדליק בפני עצמו, מדליק ומברך עליהם, וכן נוהגין</p>\n<p>Even if one is in a place of Jews and wishes to be stringent upon himself and light for himself, he may do so with blessings, and that is our practice.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Putting these two points together seems to yield that the individual in the apartment by himself could light with blessings, regardless of if anyone else will see it.</p>\n<p>It seems unreasonable that the Rema is basing his position on non-Jews seeing the lighting and fulfilling <em>pirsumei nisa</em> through them, firstly because I assume that <em>pirsumei nisa</em> is specifically to Jews, and more importantly, it does not seem reasonable that the Rema is depending on non-Jews wandering in to his private quarters, as he is lighting indoors at his table, not by the window (Rema in the previous sif), and the whole reason for the move to light inside was due to the danger of visible performance of the <em>mitzvah</em>.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 5)\n\n<p>R. Moshe Feinstein (Igros Moshe Orach Chaim 4:105:7) rules pretty definitively that one should light with a <em>bracha</em>, even if there are no other people present to allow <em>pirsumei nisa</em>.</p>\n\n<p>He is not particularly concerned with the Magen Avraham's <em>chumra</em> of waking up other members of the household in order to light late at night.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: -2)\n\n<p>See <a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=14166&st=&pgnum=277\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Beur Halacha on O.C. 571:1</a>. He cites the Gemarah (I don't recall where in the Gemarah this is mentioned) that says the mitzvah is to have one candle each night, and that suffices for himself and his household. If you live alone, you <strong>are</strong> the household. So, the fact that there are no others around is irrelevant. It seems that you can light and make the bracha as you are fulfilling the mitzvah.</p>\n\n\n",

One that caught my eye was</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><strong>עבד</strong> וְכָתוּב בְּנִמוּסֵי מִצְרַיִם, <strong>שֶׁאֵין עֶבֶד מוֹלֵךְ</strong> וְלֹא לוֹבֵשׁ בִּגְדֵי שָׂרִים:</p>\n  \n  <p>עבד a slave — and it is written in the laws of Egypt that a slave may neither <strong>become a ruler</strong> nor dress in princely robes (Genesis Rabbah 89:7).</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The other descriptions also seem to be telling Pharaoh not to promote him, but this one is the most explicit. Why would the sar hamashkim think Pharaoh would make Yosef a ruler? It's one thing to predict Pharaoh rewarding Yosef for solving the dream puzzle, but no one knew yet what Yosef would say. He ended up describing a nationwide calamity that would occur and Pharaoh appointed Yosef in charge to avoid it. But how could the sar hamashkim have predicted that? What was he driving at, reminding Pharaoh that Yosef can't become a ruler?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>Rav Hirsch points out that from the viewpoint of the butler and baker, they were <em>important officials</em>. From the viewpoint of Par'o they were his servants. In this case, if Par'o had appointed Yosef as <em>Royal Dream Interpreter</em>, he would have had a fancy title, official robes, and been part of the court with easy access to Par'o. As far as the courtiers were concerned, this would have immediately put him in a position to lobby Par'o and he would have been the newest favorite.</p>\n\n<p>Art Scroll says that Rashi explains it in this way because people act according to their basic character no matter what they do. Thus, a courtier would act like a politician attempting to keep a rival down even when trying to do something good.</p>\n\n\n",

Finally in Bereshit 37:24, it seems that the brothers listened to Reuven and threw Yosef in direction of the pit and NOT INTO the pit. It is clear that Yosef ended up finding himself into the pit because the Mindyanim took him up from the pit as the Torah says in Bereshit 37:28. So my questions are :\n- how to understand the grammatical differences here?\n- what did the brothers do exactly according to the text itself?\n- how did Yosef ended being into the pit?</p>\n\n<p>Any suggestions?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>One writer who makes something of the difference, is <a href=\"https://he.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D7%91%D7%A6%D7%9C%D7%90%D7%9C_%D7%96%D7%90%D7%91_%D7%A9%D7%A4%D7%A8%D7%9F\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">R. Betsalel Safran</a> who writes (Shu\"t HaRabaz: Notes to 1:57) that אל הבור would mean, into the pit that Reuven suggested that they throw Yosef into, (as Reuven specified אל הבור הזה; a particular pit). Instead, the Torah says וישלכו אתו הברה, which supports those commentators (see <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/a/87615/8775\">here</a>) who suggest  that they did not throw him into the pit specified by Reuven, but into a different pit.</p>\n\n<p>However, regarding אל הבור vs. הברה, I don't know that there necessarily has to be a difference in meaning (regarding different ways of saying the same thing in the Torah, see <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/q/12602/8775\">here</a>, <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/a/67569/8775\">here</a>, <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/a/18802/8775\">here</a>, and <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/q/66164/8775\">here</a>.) Some Rishonim seem to suggest that they are equivalent, see e.g. Rashi to Genesis (56:1), to Exodus (15:23), and Radak to Psalms (9:18).</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: -1)\n\n<p>Rashi on <a href=\"http://www.chabad.org/library/bible_cdo/aid/8232#v=24&showrashi=true\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Vayeishev 37:24</a> points out that the pit contained snakes and scorpions though it did not have any water.</p>\n\n<p><em>Mizrachi</em> points out that if the brothers had known about the snakes and scorpions they would have pulled him out and let him go. The fact that the snakes and scorpions did not attack Yosef made it obvious that it was a nes from Hashem. Had the brothers realized that they would not have left him there.</p>\n\n<p>Reuven would not have suggested throwing him into that pit, since he intended to come back and rescue Yosef.</p>\n\n<p>We see from this that the brothers thought that the pit was completely empty. <em>Radak</em> on 37:24 points out that Yosef did not offer any physical resistance. Thus, <code>וַיַּשְׁלִ֥כוּ אֹת֖וֹ הַבֹּ֑רָה</code>. We can also see that they did not think that it was deep enough to injure him. Reuven because he intended to rescue him and the brothers because they had decided not to kill him immediately and later they would have known that the caravan would not buy an injured slave.</p>\n\n\n",

And Reuben said to them, \"Do\n  not shed blood! Cast him into this pit, which is in the desert, but do\n  not lay a hand upon him,\" in order to save him from their hand[s], to\n  return him to his father… And they took him and cast him into the pit;\n  now the pit was empty there was no water in it.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Rashi here reports an exposition from the Talmud (Shabbos 22a, Chagigah 3a):</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Since it says: “now the pit was empty,” do I not know that there was\n  no water in it? For what purpose did the Torah write “there was no\n  water in it?” [To inform us that] there was no water in it, but there\n  were snakes and scorpions in it.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>My question:</p>\n\n<p>The purpose of putting Joseph into the pit was to save his life. Naturally, this purpose would only be served by putting him into a pit which did not contain snakes and scorpions.</p>\n\n<p>The exposition seems based on the issue of redundancy: the pit was empty and there was no water in it. But wouldn’t the more natural explanation be that the pit was empty – there were no snakes or scorpions, which would have been immediately fatal – and what’s more, there was also no water – which might have been dangerous too if the pit was wide, the water was deep, and Joseph was left there too long to continue to tread.</p>\n\n<p>In other words, isn’t the exposition contrary to the plain meaning of the passage?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>Ramban (Genesis 37:22) writes that this Midrash is not the peshat, and that the words אין בו מים aren't superfluous, and thus do not warrant the derash that there were snakes and scorpions:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>ועל דרך הפשט יאמר והבור ריק אין בו מים כלל שגם אם היו בו מים מעט יקרא רק</p>\n  \n  <p>According to the peshat it makes sense to say that the pit was empty, and had no water at all, since even if it had some water, it would still be called 'empty'.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>For a general discussion of whether Rashi is really <em>peshat</em>, see <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/q/6103/8775\">here</a>. See also my comments <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/70782/how-can-i-distinguish-pshat-from-interpretation-in-torah-translations-if-im-no#comment204858_70782\">here</a> regarding different elements of <em>peshat</em>, that different commentators, including Rashi, consider <em>peshat</em>.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>The Ben Yehoyada (Ben ish chai) (shabbos 22a) explains that the brothers didn't notice that there were snakes and scorpions in the pit, because they were hiding in holes in the walls of the pit. Therefore Reuven had no problem in throwing Yosef into the pit. Even so, the Torah uses the superfluous \"the pit was empty, it contained no water\" to teach us that there were snakes and scorpions, to teach us Yosef's level, that he was deserving of a miracle to keep him alive. Therefore it's possible to understand this explanation as p'shat, without it contradicting the rest of the passage. (There are other similar versions of this explanation that I've seen in other mefarshim, but this is the general idea)</p>\n<p>[The Rada\"k explains that the brothers <em>did</em> plan on killing him, and knew there were snakes and scorpions. He doesn't mention the contradiction between Reuven's desires and actions.]</p>\n\n\n",

But not just any Tehillim printed by them under that name, but specifically the old, original print. </p>\n\n<p>Kehot seemed to understand this \"significance\", because although they gave the Siddur Tehilas Hashem (TH) a makeover, changing the typeface and such, they didn't do so to the Tehillim OYY for many years. So even the recent clearer-printed Siddur THs have the old print Tehillim OYY in the back. </p>\n\n<p>Kehot has only just recently released a clear print version of their Tehillim, which you can see <a href=\"http://store.kehotonline.com/prodinfo.asp?number=HP-TEHIC.M\" rel=\"noreferrer\">here</a>. Before that <a href=\"http://store.kehotonline.com/prodinfo.asp?number=HP-TEHI.L\" rel=\"noreferrer\">this</a> was the staple; that's the one also that was printed in the back of their Hebrew siddurim, even the <a href=\"http://store.kehotonline.com/prodinfo.asp?number=HP-STH.LN\" rel=\"noreferrer\">new clear print versions</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Below is a sample page of the old print Tehillim OYY. What was/is the \"significance\" of saying Tehillim from the old print OYY? I also remember reading comments which didn't have nice things to say about the new clear print version of the Tehillim on several Chabad sites. Why the old print? </p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/jtCGf.gif\" rel=\"noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/jtCGf.gif\" alt=\"enter image description here\"></a></p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>I don't think it is about the typeface. If you look at the original introduction to Tehillim Ohel Yosef Yitzchok, the significance was in connecting to the original action taken by the previous Rebbe. It reads:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><strong>וכדי לעורר ולהמשיך זכותו עלינו</strong> שנתעורר באמירת התהלים בתשובה אמיתית ושתתקבלנה תפלותינו לרצון, <strong>קראנו להוצאת תהלים זה על שמו בשם אהל יוסף יצחק</strong>.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>That action, <a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=32596&st=&pgnum=3\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">like is mentioned in the opening words of the introduction</a>, was the recital of Tehillim in a minyan each day according the division of Tehillim according to the days of the month or in a time of communal danger according to the days of the week. One example of the previous Rebbe discussing this is from his <a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=31629&st=&pgnum=425\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Igrot Kodesh, volume 4, page 388, paragraph 3</a>. That letter was from 1938. This same idea was underlined in the accompanying booklet called Kovetz Michtavim which was printed in the original Tehillim Ohel Yosef Yitzchok.</p>\n\n<p>Additional evidence that the typeface has nothing to do with it is from the action of the current Rebbe himself with the publication in 1953 of <a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=15664&st=&pgnum=1&hilite=\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Tehillim Ohel Yosef Yitzchok HaShalem</a>. That edition included the commentaries from Mikraot Gadolot together with the commentary of the Tzemach Tzedek (Yahel Ohr). The typeface for the Tehillim itself was completely different from the version you show above but the original introduction was still included.</p>\n\n\n",

In Gan Eden they learn the entire Oral Torah (he proves this from the gemara which says \"אשרי מי שבא לכאן ותלמודו בידו\"). But while we learn \"the ox that gores the cow\" as a practical law for a physical ox goring a physical cow, in Gan Eden they learn the law of \"the ox that gores the cow\" spiritually, in connection to the ox of the chariot in ma'ase merkava.</p>\n\n<p>A similar idea is mentioned in his Likutei Amarim (<a href=\"http://chabadlibrary.org/books/adhaz/tanya/1/5.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">chapter 5</a>), that if one understands any part of the Torah, even a theoretical law that never actually happened in real life, means that the Torah, is \"digested\" in his soul, or that soul is \"dressed\" in the Torah, representing God's will. The concept of a \"dress\" is also mentioned tangentially in Likutei Torah (above). However, in this case he doesn't mention \"the ox that gores a cow\" as an example, but rather an unspecified monetary dispute (שכשיטעון ראובן כך וכך דרך משל ושמעון כך וכך יהיה הפסק ביניהם כך וכך).</p>\n\n<p>Neither of these sources compares \"the ox that gores the cow\" to \"I am H' your God,\" but I think that this is probably the source for the idea of the holiness of \"the ox that gores the cow.\"</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>Perhaps you are thinking of the following comment of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maimonides\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rambam</a> (based on the Talmud in <a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/shas.aspx?mesechta=24&daf=99&format=pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Sanhedrin 99a</a>):</p>\n\n<p><strong>Commentary to the Mishnah, Introduction to Perek Chelek</strong></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>ואין הבדל בין וּבְנֵי חָם כּוּשׁ וּמִצְרַיִם וּפוּט וּכְנָעַן וְשֵׁם\n  אִשְׁתּוֹ מְהֵיטַבְאֵל בַּת מַטְרֵד וְתִמְנַע הָיְתָה פִילֶגֶשׁ ובין\n  אָנֹכִי ה' ושְׁמַע יִשְׂרָאֵל ה' אֱלֹהֵינוּ ה' אֶחָד הכל מפי הגבורה\n  והכל תורת ה' תמימה טהורה וקדושה אמת</p>\n  \n  <p>And there is no difference between [the verses] \"and the sons of Cham\n  were Kush and Mitzraim and Put and Canaan\" \"and the name of his wife\n  was Mehetavel the daughter of Matrad\" \"and Timna was a concubine\" and\n  between [the verses] \"I am the LORD\" and \"Hear O Israel the LORD is\n  our God the LORD is one\".

It's just if you can get the treatment and deport the body away from being defiled, you cannot be lazy  and say it's הותרה because one should always do as little transgessions as possible. This follows the Rema in SA OC 328,12: >הגה: ויש אומרים דאם אפשר לעשות בלא דיחוי ובלא איחור על ידי שינוי עושה על ידי שינוי -.<br>\n I.e whatever you can do to avoid prohibition even in a case of pikuach nefesh should be done provided this does not affect the person in danger.</p>\n\n<p>.</p>\n\n<p>P.S Unfortunately, Your predicament is common-place in France, as there is a law for French citizens that if they die in hospital, their body is detained for 3 days for a post-mortem. Rabbi Goredetski who is the head of a Chabad house in Place du Temple in the 11th arrondissement of Paris told me that they have to use connections with the hierarchy of the hospital in order to let the body go prematurely in order to bury it as soon as possible without defiling the body as per Halacha.</p>\n\n\n",

This is essentially the plot of Tuviya, but with much of the story cut off and most of the details removed, as Professor Grintz wrote.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hanoch_Albeck\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Chanoch Albeck</a> also said that this siman is a summarized version of Tuviya (<a href=\"https://www.nli.org.il/he/books/NNL_ALEPH001986846/NLI\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Beresheet Rabbati, Introduction, pg. 15</a>) and Neubauer also brought this midrash in <a href=\"https://archive.org/details/TheBookOfTobitAChaldeeTextFromAUniqueMs.InTheBodleianLibraryWithOtherRabbinicalT/page/n1/mode/2up\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">his edition of Tobit</a>.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><sup>1</sup> A note on Midrash Rabbah d'Rabbah: Scholars such as <a href=\"https://he.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D7%A2%D7%9E%D7%95%D7%A1_%D7%97%D7%9B%D7%9D\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Amos Chacham</a> (in his essay מדרש בראשית רבתי, in Sinai vol. 8, pp. 372-374) and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abraham_Epstein\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Avraham Epstein</a> (in his essay Bereschit Rabbati, Magazin fur die Wissenschaft des Judentums, vol. 15, <a href=\"https://sammlungen.ub.uni-frankfurt.de/cm/periodical/titleinfo/12454265\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">pp. 65-99</a> believed that this midrash was the same midrash known as \"Midrash Rabbah Rabbati\", quoted or paraphrased several times by <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judah_Gedalia\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rabbi Yehudah Gedalyah</a>. Chacham thought that the midrash had been composed or compiled by <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moshe_ha-Darshan\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rabbi Moshe Ha'darshan</a>, and that the book <a href=\"https://trmarvin.org/knowledgebase/bereshit-rabbati/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Beresheet Rabbati</a> associated with him is a later summary of Rabbi Moshe's original work by an unknown darshan.

Ch. 70) where the Midrash relates the tithes that Jacob designated and Tobit (1:7-9) where he too designated tithes on his journeys to Jerusalem for the festivals. </p>\n\n<p>Alternatively, Tobit is reported to have instructed his son Tobias to present generous alms giving to the angel who aided in returning them safely (Tobit beg. Ch. 12) and this too is construed as a parallel to Jacob's oath uttered during his importunate state. </p>\n\n\n",

The current text of the Pentateuch is therefore considered perfectly consistent with the original verbalization of the words of Hashem, as it was drafted  by Moses.</p>\n\n<p>This narration regarding the rewriting of the Pentateuch by Ezra HaSofer seems to me  completely unknown outside the Jewish world; I have never personally found any trace in the numerous books written by Western scholars and read by me.</p>\n\n<p>I ask to  you  the courtesy of confirming if this narrative is actually in conformity with the Jewish sources, and if possible, the courtesy of  providing  me with the relative passages of the Talmud, or at least the extremes of the same so that I can search for them. </p>\n\n<p>I know this passage of the Talmud: “Reish Lakish said, ‘at first the Torah was forgotten by Israel; Ezra came from Babylon and established it'” (Sukkah 20a).\nDoes it have any relevance?</p>\n\n<p>Shalom </p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 6)\n\n<p>I do not have the original source, but from memory, Ezrah used the best copies of the Torah available and wrote (from them) an authoritative copy to be used by all future sofrim (scribes).

After the death of the king, these\n  highly accurate Torah scrolls were kept by the Sanhedrin.</p>\n  \n  <p>A Torah was likewise kept in the Second Temple which was read at the\n  great assembly on Yom Kippur and at the Public Reading every seven\n  years.

It is forbidden to write a single letter without\n  copying it from another Torah.</p>\n  \n  <p>Moreover, the scribe must repeat every word out loud before writing it\n  down, so as to insure accuracy in copying. This was the custom among\n  the prophets, as we find, \"He pronounced all these words for me with\n  his mouth, and I wrote them with ink in the book\" (Jeremiah 36:18).</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>...</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Originally, the Torah and other scripture were so carefully preserved\n  that every letter, word, and sentence was counted.

    "content": "# What does the Halakhah says regarding Devarim, 22.13-21 regarding מוציא שם רע - Motzi Shem Ra?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>I am an Italian gentile believer in HaShem, who engages in the observance of the noahide precepts, as commanded by the Creator in the Torah.</p>\n\n<p>I have never understood the exact meaning of Devarim 22:13-21 (translation from <a href=\"http://www.chabad.org/library/bible_cdo/aid/9986/jewish/Chapter-22.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">chabad.org</a>)</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>If a man takes a wife, is intimate with her and despises her, and he\n  makes libelous charges against her and gives her a bad name, saying,\n  \"I took this woman, and when I came to her, I did not find any\n  evidence of virginity for her.\" Then the girl's father and her mother\n  shall obtain evidence of the girl's virginity, and take it out to the\n  elders of the city, to the gate. And the girl's father shall say to\n  the elders, \"I gave my daughter to this man as a wife, and he despised\n  her; And behold, he made libelous charges, saying, 'I did not find\n  evidence of your daughter's virginity.' But this is the evidence of my\n  daughter's virginity!' And they shall spread the garment before the\n  elders of the city. Then, the elders of that city shall take the man\n  and chasten him. And they shall fine him one hundred [shekels of] silver because he\n  defamed a virgin of Israel, and he give it to the girl's father. And\n  she shall be his wife; he shall not send her away all the days of his\n  life.</p>\n  \n  <p>But if this matter was true: [indeed,] no evidence of the girl's\n  virginity was found they shall take the girl out to the entrance of\n  her father's house, and the men of her city shall pelt her with\n  stones, and she shall die, for she did a disgraceful thing in Israel,\n  to commit adultery [in] her father's house. So shall you clear away\n  the evil from among you.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>My questions are these:</p>\n\n<p>Is it correct to state that this is a case of adultery? In Italian translations it translates as \"prostituting herself in her father's house\"</p>\n\n<p>If I am not mistaken, according to the Torah the obligation of sexual fidelity of a woman arises with the celebration of \"Kiddushin\", by virtue of which the woman becomes \"arusah\", and commits adultery if she joins carnally with a man different from her promised groom. In the circumstance described by the aforementioned Devarim passage, how do you know if the woman had sexual relations before or after the celebration of Kiddushin?</p>\n\n<p>If I am not mistaken Jewish Law provides that the death penalty may be applied, in the cases provided by the Torah, only in the presence of two witnesses, and prior warning against the offender, on the part of the same, on the criminal consequences of the his action. In the case in question, do we not miss the two witnesses who have seen the illicit sexual relationship, and consequently also miss the preliminary warning?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>The Torah speaks here of two different cases happening between <em>Kiddushin</em> and <em>Nisuin</em>. At this stage, the woman is already promised to a man and cannot have relations with others. The translation you mention (\"in her father's house\") is because the woman still lives with her family until <em>Nisuin</em>.</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p>If the husband, after <em>Nisuin</em> decides he doesn't want the woman anymore, the Torah protects her by ensuring she cannot be divorced anymore</p></li>\n<li><p>If the husband finds the woman has indeed had a relation between <em>Kiddushin</em> and <em>Nisuin</em>, she is condemned to death. As you mention, this is only if there are two witnesses (the Rambam mentions this explicitly, see <a href=\"http://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/960636/jewish/Chapter-Three.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Hilchot Naarah Betulah 3:12</a> and <a href=\"http://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/960649/jewish/Issurei-Biah-Chapter-Three.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Hilchot Issurei Biah 3:9</a>)</p></li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>See e.g., <a href=\"http://thetorah.com/deuteronomys-uncompromising-demand-for-womens-sexual-fidelity/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a> for more.</p>\n\n\n### ✅ Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>You are right that this is a case of adultary that happenned after she was betrothed to her Husband who Defamed her.  Thos is evident from Deuteronomy 24,1: \"The man took a wife\"<br>\nYou are also right that there are 2 witnesses to make her liable to death by stoning.           </p>\n\n<p>This is all clear from Babilonian Talmud Ketubot 44b (the oral law see source below). The only way for the testimony not to be true, is if the father brings 2 other witnesses that say the first pair of witnesses fabricated  their testimony, because they were with them at the same time in a place where it was impossible for those defaming witnesses to testify on that woman i.e what they \"saw\" was fabricated (zommem). Ketubot 45b says Those original witnesses are punished by stoning in her place, and if the husband had brought the eidim to testify (i.e they didn't come voluntarily), he pays 100 silver shekalim and gets lashes according to Chachamim. Rabbi Yehuda says he only pays 100 shekalim only if he hires the false witnesses with money. </p>\n\n<p>Source Ketubot 44b:                               </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>תני שילא שלש מדות בנערה באו לה עדים בבית חמיה שזינתה בבית אביה -<br>\n  Sheila taught in a baraita: There are three different circumstances with regard to a young woman who has been defamed. If witnesses came to testify about her when she was in her father-in-law’s house, i.e., after she was married, and stated that she committed adultery in her father’s house, when she was betrothed,<br>\n  סוקלין אותה על פתח בית אביה כלומר ראו גידולים שגידלתם באו לה עדים בבית אביה שזינתה בבית אביה סוקלין אותה על פתח שער העיר סרחה ולבסוף בגרה תידון בחנק -<br>\n  one stones her at the entrance to her father’s house, as though to say: See what you have brought up. If witnesses came to testify about her when she was in her father’s house, i.e., when she was betrothed, and testified that she committed adultery in her father’s house, one stones her at the entrance to the gate of the city. If she went astray and sinned when she was a young woman and subsequently reached majority, i.e., she became a grown woman, she is sentenced to strangulation, which is the punishment for a grown woman who committed adultery.<br>\n  או היא או זוממיה מקדימין לבית הסקילה<br>\n  Either she or her conspiring witnesses are brought early in the morning to the place of stoning.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

    "title": "Are professor Daniel Boyarin's writings about the messiah supported in traditional Jewish sources?",
    "content": "# Are professor Daniel Boyarin's writings about the messiah supported in traditional Jewish sources?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>I bought and read the Italian edition of the book “The Jewish Gospels.The story of the Jewish Christ”, written by Daniel Boyarin, a professor of Talmudic culture at the University of Berkeley. I was struck by the fact that Boyarin, while claiming to be an orthodox Jew, argues that the figure of \"one like a son of man\" mentioned in Daniel's book has been interpreted in ancient Jewish exegesis, or at least in a significant part of it, as proving the divine nature of the Messiah, who would be subordinate to HaShem, but would share his deity to some extent. Therefore, according to Boyarin, the idea of a celestial and divine Messiah incarnate in Jesus the Nazarene would not be out of the Jewish tradition, for many Jews believed in the Messiah as being divine and supernatural. Boyarin also argues that the \"servant suffering\" of Isaiah 53 represents the Messiah for an authoritative and ancient part of Jewish tradition.</p>\n\n<p>I am a Noah's son and not a Christian, so I do not believe in Christian dogmas. The reading of this book has puzzled me, because, for what I know, the Jewish tradition interprets both Daniel 7 and Isaiah 53 as images of the people of Israel, and not as steps referring to the Messiah; moreover, in the teaching of the Masters of Israel, the Messiah is a human and not divine being, save my mistake. In support of his thesis, Boyarin cites a few textual sources, which, in my ignorance, seem to me to be dubious.</p>\n\n<p>On Daniel 7 as the image of the Divine Messiah, in addition to generally arguing that coming with the clouds of heaven\" is a constant characteristic of theophany throughout the Tanakh\", Boyarin reports the following passage of the Babylonian Talmud Chagigah 14a:</p>\n\n<p>One passage says: His throne was fiery flames, 16 and another passage says: \"Till thrones were places, and one that was ancient of days did sit.\" 17 - There is no contradiction: one [throne] for Him, and one for David; This is the view of R. Akiba. Said R. Jose the Galilean to him: Akiba, how long will you treat the Divine Presence as profane? 18 Rather, [it must mean], one for justice and one for grace.19 Did he accept [this explanation from him, or Did not he accept it? - Come and hear: One for justice and one for grace; This is the view of R. Akiba.</p>\n\n<p>Boyarin commented on the aforementioned passage: \"Whatever is the precise interpretation of this Talmudic passage (which I have long discussed in my other publication), there is no doubt that both rabbis would see in Daniel a theophany. Rabbi Akiva sees you two divine figures in heaven, that of God the Father and that of the king David after his apotheosis. Rabbi Yose the  Galilean disputes him. \"</p>\n\n<p>The only other Jewish sources reported by Boyarin on the son of man as the Divine Messiah are quotes from the apocrypha \"Early Book of Enoch\" and \"Fourth Book of Ezra.\"</p>\n\n<p>Regarding the \"servant suffering\" of Isaiah 53 interpreted as a step referring to the Messiah, Boyarin mentions the Talmud of Babylon Sanhedrin 98b, where, in relation to the name of the Messiah, it is written: \"The Rabbis said: His name is' The leper scholar, 'as it is written, Surely he has borne our griefs, and carried our sorrows; yet we esteemed him a leper, smitten of God, and afflicted.'</p>\n\n<p>Boyarin also speaks of Rabbi Moshe Alshekh, who would write \"our rabbis, in unison, accept and affirm that the prophet (Isaiah) is talking about the King Messiah\";and of Nachmanide, who claims, according to Boyarin, that according to the midrash and the rabbis of the Talmud, Isaiah 53 speaks from the beginning to the end of the Messiah, even though the great Spanish rabbi does not agree with this interpretation.</p>\n\n<p>Are Boyarin's references correct? Is this a known author in Israel, and what rating does it give him? I am very puzzled about the quality of this publication, which seems to me in contrast to rabbinic teaching.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 12)\n\n<p>The main point in the question seems to be:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The idea of a celestial and divine Messiah incarnate in Jesus the Nazarene would not be out of the Jewish tradition, for many Jews believed in the Messiah as being divine and supernatural.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The question is, do the referenced sources support that conclusion.</p>\n\n<p>You list several sources: The fourth book of Ezra, Enoch, and Talmudic interpretations of Daniel and Isaiah.</p>\n\n<p>The <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2_Esdras#Author_and_criticism\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Fourth Book of Ezra</a> dates from sometime between the first and third centuries. If it dates to the later end, then there would be no evidence that Jews in the time of Jesus would have considered such beliefs acceptable.</p>\n\n<p>It should also be noted that the first two chapters known as <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2_Esdras#5_Ezra\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">5 Ezra</a> are generally considered to be of Christian provenance. I do not know if Boyarin draws any evidence from there.</p>\n\n<p>Even more important, is that even were one to accept Boyarin's interpretation (not that I have any reason to), regardless of which part of the work he is dealing with, there is no evidence that it was in any way representative of Judaism; be it the dominant set of believes among Jews of the period, or any time prior. After all, Christianity itself is a Jewish cult from the period, replete with texts, yet that hardly proves that Christianity is Judaism, or was ever accepted as such.</p>\n\n<p>The same goes for the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Book_of_Enoch\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Book of Enoch</a>. Not only is not a part of the Jewish canon, and does not necessarily reflect Jewish consensus, the earliest rabbis were opposed to elements of it. For example, the interpretation of Bnei Elohim was condemned by R. Shimon ben Yohai (cf. Genesis Rabba 26:2, in ed. Albeck). Incidentally, this latter example similarly seems to preclude the Christian usage of the term in regards to Jesus (see <a href=\"http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14142b.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a>). This is significant, considering Boyarin is attempting to cast Jesus as consistent with rabbinic thought. See <a href=\"https://medium.com/@jayshams/the-problem-with-the-jewish-gospels-b80eb0aa0219\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">this critique of Boyarin</a> that basically makes the same point.</p>\n\n<p>That leaves the the interpretation of Daniel and Isaiah. Regarding Daniel, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Sch%C3%A4fer\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"> Peter Schäfer</a> has already heavily critiqued this, and shown it to be without basis, (cited <a href=\"https://kavvanah.wordpress.com/2012/05/30/peter-schafer-responds-to-daniel-boyarin/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a>).</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Larry_Hurtado\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Larry Hurtado</a> similarly concludes that the evidences indicates the opposite of Boyarin's claims, (see <a href=\"https://larryhurtado.wordpress.com/2012/06/01/schafers-review-of-boyarins-the-jewish-gospels/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a>). Neither of these two scholars are Jewish.</p>\n\n<p>Regarding Hagiga (14a), the evidence is simply not there. We have a cryptic verse mentioning a vision of thrones being set up, and mentioning that God sat on one. According to R. Yossi, the two thrones represent two modes of God's behaviour; merciful and kind. There is absolutely no evidence whatsoever, on the basis of this passage, to suggest that according to R. Yossi, God is physical. This is no different form any other prophecy in which an image represents God; hardly evidence of a corporeal God.</p>\n\n<p>Even according to R. Akiva, that the seat is for Messiah, there is no evidence at all, that Messiah or God are physical; just that there is a seat reserved for the Messiah. It could easily be suggested that R. Yossi was merely opposed to the suggestion that the two were juxtaposed, rather than that R. Akiva was actually in some way equating God and the Messiah.</p>\n\n<p>Furthermore, this whole passage seems like <em>derash</em> interpreting Daniel as referring specifically to two chairs and identifying the second chair. According to the peshat, one can easily read Daniel as referencing multiple chairs occupied by God and the court referenced in the next verse as sitting.</p>\n\n<p>The court seems to be angelic from context, and seems no more theologically radical than any other angels.</p>\n\n<p>Regarding Sanhedrin (98b), it is important to note the difference between peshat and derash. The latter refers to a didactic method, while the former refers to an interpretive method. More specifically, the former refers (as I am using the term here) to interpretation based on the simple reading of the text, taking into account grammar, context, and logic. Derash, on the other hand is a didactic mode of transmitting teachings using text as a medium. Accordingly, in the arena of derash, points are frequently made that have nothing to do with the context of the verses. (See Moreh Nevokhim 3:43). Accordingly, a derash of a verse is a poor proof for how the rabbis interpreted the verse in context. For a discussion of Isaiah 53, from a traditional perspective, see <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/a/73756/8775\">here</a> which cites Origen, a third century Christian scholar who concedes that Jews interpret it as referring to Israel.</p>\n\n<p>Furthermore, even were Isaiah 53 referring to the Messiah, there is little proof to anything really that controversial. While such passages are significant since centuries later they were resurrected by Christians, and traditionalists endeavored to show that they were taken out of context, vague verses about a suffering servant are hardly proof for anything about Jesus, even were there reason to think they relate to the Messiah.  </p>\n\n<p>Regarding Boyarin, as an individual, he is certainly not a traditional scholar. Although he identifies himself as Orthodox, the positions he suggests are far from Orthodox. I can anecdotally attest that the average traditional Jew has never heard of Boyarin.</p>\n\n<p>More significantly, it is clear that the average believing Jew would not consider the positions that he suggests were held by Jews at the turn of the first millennium, to be acceptable. They are certainly not accepted today as traditional, and indeed, for millennia traditional Jews have wholly rejected Christianity as heresy, even at the price of death. The idea of a corporeal God was soundly rejected by Rav Saadya Gaon (Maamar 2), Hovot Halevavot (Shaar HaYihud: 10), Rambam (Hilkot Teshuva 3:7), and numerous others. Furthermore, while not all Jews always espoused correct beliefs, including scholars (cf. Raavad's animadversions to Hilkhot Teshuva there), I am not aware of any scholars who dispute the principle of God's uniqueness, or would tolerate a divine messianic human. </p>\n\n<p>Indeed, although Boyarin apparently ignores the issue of trinity, as  noted by Schäfer:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Boyarin forgets about the Holy Spirit and the Trinitarian claim, and focuses instead on the binitarian idea of two divine powers</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>It nevertheless seems clear that Christianity was rejected as heretical by the Jews at the time of Jesus, as related for example, in John (5:18, 10:33) which relates that the Jews wanted to kill Jesus for his comparing himself to God, and claiming to be God. It seems that Jews at the time considered the very declaration of a man to be divine, as heretical. See also Matthew (26:63-6) and Mark (14:53-64). Although the historicity of the above sources has been questioned, all later Jewish sources unequivocally reject Christianity.</p>\n\n<p>The Talmud seems to have understood Christianity to be avoda zara (typically translated as idolatry), a position clearly seconded by Rambam (<a href=\"http://www.mechon-mamre.org/i/5211.htm#4\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Hilkhot Maakhalot Assurot 11:4</a>, <a href=\"http://www.mechon-mamre.org/i/1409.htm#4\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Hilkhot Avoda Zara 9:4</a>) and  all major authorities until today (see <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/q/89/8775\">here</a>). Although they address trinity, while Boyarin, as noted, is dealing with binitarian, there is no reason to suggest that that distinction would be relevant here.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Was Rabbi Akiva exempt from his conjugal duties?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>The Gemara (in Kesubos 63a) says, “When Rabbi Akiva returned, he brought twelve thousand students with him. As he approached his home, he heard a certain old man saying to [his wife], ‘Until when will you lead a life of living widowhood?’ She answered him, ‘If he would listen to me, he would sit in the beis medrash another twelve years.’ Hearing this, [R’ Akiva] said to himself, ‘I am acting with my wife’s permission.’ He went back and sat another twelve years in the beis medrash…”. </p>\n\n<p>Being that a husband has a biblical obligation to have marital relations with his wife (<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Onah\" rel=\"noreferrer\">onah</a>), I assume that for the first 12 years R' Akiva received an exemption from his wife so that he did not need to return home to perform this mitzvah. I further assume that R' Akiva took his wife's (overheard) statement as a continuation of this exemption. I would like to know if any sources discuss this and if such an exemption (ie, not explicitly stated, but perhaps implied) can be learned out l'halacha from this aggadah. </p>\n\n<p>If there are any sources which contradict my assumptions and offer other reasons why R' Akiva was exempt from this mitzvah (or state that he came home to perform it at certain periods) I would accept those as an answer as well. </p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>The Rambam writes  (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Mishneh_Torah,_Marriage.14.2?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Hilkhot Ishut 14:2</a>) that a <em>talmid chacham</em> is exempt from marital relations for up to 3 years without having to ask permission.

Either that, or R Akiva had children before he left to study: <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/a/36826/11501\">this answer</a> says R Akiva had a son from a previous marriage before he married Rachel, and that he learned for many years locally after he married her. <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/a/16201/11501\">That answer</a> goes in a similar direction.</p>\n\n<p>In all cases, as long as his wife gave him permission (which is clear from the text you quote) he was not in violation of her mitzva of <em>onah</em>.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>There is an interesting Maharshoh on that Gemoro in fact its on Daf 62b D.H.OZAL that it seems there are a few stories involving various Tanoim and Amoroim and 12 years in this Gemoro and this time lapse is based on the famous Mishna in Pirkei Ovos about the different stages in life at different years,so Ben 18 is LeChuppa and Ben 30 is Lirdoif ,so you could learn from this Maharshoh that perhaps Rabbi Akiva as mentioned in the Medrash at the end of Parshas Vayechi only started to learn when he was 40 got married and had relations with his wife before he left  and maybe based on the above Mishna he started  his  12 years to learn at 40 with the Brochoh of his new wife went off to learn for 12 years and on his return he heard her saying that she would be happy for him to learn another 12 years. </p>\n\n<p>The Gemoro in Moed Koton Daf 21b clearly tells us that Rabbi Akiva definitely had children unfortunately they pre-deceased him and he had to give a Hesped for them.</p>\n\n\n",

This is the reason why a Mamzer can marry a slave woman as he is already a product of an illegitimate relationship in Kiddushin 59a, see Rashi there, and Rambam Issurei bia 15,3. and Shulchan Aruch Even Haezer 4,20.</p>\n\n<p>So that is why these 2 Pesukim are clearly not Halachically referring to a relationship with a Gentile contrary to what some Rabbis mistakenly preach.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Is it correct to say that in the Jewish tradition the honorary title \"Maràn\" has never been used to refer to HaShem?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>I am an Italian gentile believer in HaShem, who engages in the observance of the noahide precepts, as commanded by the Creator in the Torah. </p>\n\n<p>In the numerous debates I have with my catholic christian friends, a definite contrast emerged on whether Jesus the Nazarene was seen also by his first followers as the incarnation of the Creator. I pointed out to them that the first Hebrew disciples of Jesus called him \"Maràn\", as attested in the expression, also present in the New Testament, \"Maranatha\", which can be read Marana tha (\"come, our Mar\") or Maràn atha (\"Our Mar has come.) Now, Christian exegesis translates Maran with\" Our Lord”, and believes that this is a divine title, in which the\" Lord \"we are talking about is HaShem; this interpretation is conditioned by the fact that the Divine Tetragrammaton YH ** has been rendered, in the Greek translation of the Tanakh known as \"The Seventy\", with the Greek expression \"o κύριος\", which means \"The Lord\", confirming the Hebrew use of substituting, in the recitation, the predicted (and forbidden) pronunciation of YH ** with the word \"Adonai\".</p>\n\n<p>My christian friends are fully convinced of the correctness of this interpretation of \"Maràn\", but I have countered by referring to the millennial Jewish tradition, in which Maràn has the meaning of \"Our Master\", and indicates an honorary title attributed to rabbis of particular authority, such as the case of Rabbi Yosef Karo, the editor of Shulchan Arukh, and as is still the practice today in the Haredi community (see the example of the late Rabbi Ovadia Yosef). Moreover, if it is true that the Aramaic mar also means lord, it is also true that, as in all the languages of the world, even in Aramaic and Hebrew the word lord is also used for human beings endowed with particular authority, not only for the Creator, and this is amply attested by the sources.</p>\n\n<p>Therefore, I told my friends that It does not seem illogical to think that the first followers of Jesus, who according to the same Christian sources were all Jews and observed the Torah, at least the written one, saw in the Nazarene the Messiah announced by the scriptures but NOT the incarnation of HaShem, attributing to their guide the epithet of \"Our Master\", and that the divinization of Jesus happened because of the pagan-Hellenistic influences brought  by the apostate of Torah Paul of Tarsus and his followers of gentile origin. My Christian friends have very attached to my opinion, but patience ...</p>\n\n<p>Is my approach correct, or are there examples in Jewish sources of a use of the Maran title to refer to HaShem?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 5)\n\n<p>The word can be used to refer to God, see e.g. Daniel (5:23):</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>וְעַ֣ל מָרֵֽא־שְׁמַיָּ֣א ׀ הִתְרוֹמַ֡מְתָּ</p>\n  \n  <p>You exalted yourself against the Lord of Heaven</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>However, the term <em>mar</em>, and related words, do not imply divinity.

So assuming their existence and dissemination, after the destruction of the first temple, did these stories have any effect on the people's interest in building a second temple (knowing that it was fated to be destroyed)?</p>\n\n<p>I'm not asking about here anyone's reluctance to build the first temple though that might have the same contextual problem. I'm also not concerned here with anyone's reluctance due to more immediate prophecies related to the behavior of the Jewish people -- just to the pre-existing knowledge that there were already, on the books, prophecies that 2 temples would be destroyed.</p>\n\n<p>So was there any impact on the drive to rebuild which can be attributed to a realization that another destruction had already been foretold? </p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<ol>\n<li>There's a big difference between seeing in \"Ruach haKodesh\" and a prophecy. A prophecy is commanded to be publicized, where the seeing is not. THe only prophecies we know are about the foreseen destruction of the first Temple, there are no open prophecies about the destruction of the second, despite the fact that you are right about \"them both to be destined to be destroyed\".</li>\n<li>According to Rambam, the negative prophecies do not have to be fulfilled, and people's actions can reverse them, as in the Yonah and the Ninveh story. So even if it was openly prophecized, the Jews had an option to repent and reverse it.</li>\n<li>As we hold that Hashem \"פוקד עוון אבות על בנים\", it takes a couple of generations to result in a destruction, and it is not the last generation's sole fault. Moreover, public prophecies only set the general guidelines, it adds nothing to personal observance. It might be emotionally tough, but mentally and Halakhicly nothing changes - the positive commandment of building the Temple (acc to Rambam) is constantly in force.</li>\n</ol>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>I think that looking backwards in time, it seems as if the destruction of the Temple were foretold from the beginning. This is obvious to us, because we live after those events, and we know that two temples were eventually destroyed.</p>\n\n<p>But if you actually lived at that time, it wouldn't have been clear. Jeremiah prophesied about the destruction of the Temple long before it was actually destroyed, but Hananiah the son of Azzur also prophesied that Babylon's yoke would be broken and the stolen vessels from the Temple would be returned (Jeremiah 28). When we read this story, we know Jeremiah is the \"good guy\" because he ended up being right, but it's only clear in retrospect. To the people, there were two different options being foretold, and not everyone knew that one was obviously right.</p>\n\n\n",

However, all of these payments are triggered by physical pain. </p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>Theoretical scenario #1: Reuven verbally bullies Shimon terribly throughout school. Shimon suffers severe psychological trauma as a result. He then goes to a psychologist to help him recover. Can Shimon force Reuven to pay for the psychologist visits? One might be inclined to say yes, since this was caused as a result of Reuven’s actions; however, perhaps, as noted above, only physical pain triggers payment. </p>\n\n<p>Theoretical scenario #2: Reuven <em>physically</em> bullies Shimon. Obviously Reuven has to pay for the physical damage, but does he have to pay for the psychologist visits in this scenario? Unlike before, there is now physical damage triggering the payments. On the other hand, it’s not the physical pain that’s being treated. Even with boshes payment, that is for embarrassment caused by the physical attack, whereas here it’s still a purely psychological “wound.”</p>\n\n<p>Theoretical scenario #3: Reuven kills Shimon’s pet. It is well-known that Shimon was very attached to this pet. Obviously Reuven must pay for the physical damage to the pet; must Reuven pay for the psychologist visit in this scenario, which is even more removed (possibly) than scenario #2?</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>In other words: <strong>Can one be forced to pay for psychological treatment required by his actions, and if so, how direct must it be?</strong></p>\n\n<p>Assume for simplicity’s sake that all parties are legally competent (i.e. adult, sane, etc.) Jews, and that there are witnesses, etc., which would force Reuven to pay if payment is called for.</p>\n\n<p><sub><strong>PLEASE CYLOR IF THIS IS RELEVANT TO YOU.</strong></sub></p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 6)\n\n<p>A very relevant passage is Nidda (47a) which relates that Sh'muel, examined the body of his slave, to better understand the maturity process and at which point <em>bagrut</em> is achieved. He then paid her 400 zuz to compensate her for the indignity. He explained that the Torah allows one to work a slave; not to embarrass her.</p>\n\n<p>It seems that compensation was necessary even though there is no evidence that he physically hurt her, or even physically touched her; just that he embarrassed her. Rambam cites Sh'muel's reasoning (Avadim 9:8).</p>\n\n<p>Tosafot (s.v. badak) claims that this payment was not technically necessary, since according to one view, slaves are not subject to boshet payments, and if they are, it goes to their master. However, there is no suggestion that he would have been exempt from paying since there is no evidence that he physically hurt her, or even touched her. Rather, it seems the embarrassment alone would warrant compensation, even according to Tosafot.[i]</p>\n\n<p>It would seem probable that the other elements of compensation would apply as well. However, <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/a/87783/8775\">this answer</a> notes that the Bavli Bava Kamma (56a) cites the Tosefta Bava Kamma (6:16, in R. Lieberman's edition), that states that someone who scares someone else is liable according to <em>dieni Shamayim</em>; heavenly law, but exempt from payment in human court. Bava Kamma (91a) explains that the damage was facilitated by the victim, so the perpetrator is exempt.</p>\n\n<p>This exemption seems to be referring to <em>nezek</em> damage (as the same passage in Tosefta applies the same ruling to scaring animals, where the relevant payment would be <em>nezek</em>.</p>\n\n<p>However, it is not clear (to me) that in every case of bullying the bully would be exempt from payment. The exemption seems to be based on the exemption of damage via <em>g'rama</em>; indirect means, (as explained by Tosafot Talmid Rabbenu Tam to Bava Kamma 36b, Rabbenu Hananel Bar Sh'muel to Kiddushin 25a and Riaz Bava Kamma 6:1:12). It could be argued that by definition, psychological damage depends on the psyche of the victim, therefore there is a factor other than the bully, but it could also be argued that if the victim is sufficiently helpless (for example an infant) that psychological damage imposed might not be considered to be based on the victim, but just the perpetrator.</p>\n\n<p>Even if he would be exempt from 'nezek', it is not clear that he would be exempt from other forms of compensation (such as boshet, which as indicated above it would seem he would have to pay). After all, boshet is by definition based on the perception of the victim, yet there is no exemption for boshet. Meiri writes (Bava Kamma 91a) that even in cases where the above exemption exists, the perpetrator would still have to pay boshet. However, the Meiri exempts him from the other compensatory payments.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>[i] See Arukh Laner. If I understand correctly, he states that according to Rambam, the payment is an actual necessity; not like Tosafot.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>The halacha in C.M. 420'32' states that a person who scares and alarms his friend who in turn is damaged emotionally is not liable in beit din as the Gemara in Baba Kama 91'a' explains that it was he himself who let himself become frightened and be disturbed. A person possessing strength and confidence shall not get blown away by this.</p>\n\n<p>This, according to the Chazon Yechezkel Babaa Kama 6' 5', includes a case where the one being hurt cannot prevent his mind from being damaged due to his psyche. </p>\n\n<p>The same would be when one should scream into one's ears and thereby deafen him he would not be liable for the same reason,and referring to this, the aforementioned Chazon Yechezkel says that even when he wasn't able to turn his head away the screamer is potur.</p>\n\n<p>This is unless it is done as the halacha calls it begufoh meaning he, for instance, grabbed on to his friend's ears when screaming into it as that shall be considered direct hezek and would have him liable for its ramifications. </p>\n\n<p>Therefore when considering our case if he bullied him and the one bullied being inept lets himself be subjugated to the bully he himself is the cause of the damage done.</p>\n\n<p>If the Bully acted via physically taking charge of him, hands on the boy then he shall be liable to compensate for the sessions.</p>\n\n<p>Midinei shomaim, however, he is liable in any case as it is by any g'ramah. </p>\n\n\n",

Albeck: Parashat Vayechi: 97) states that Yaakov praised Yehuda for saving Yosef from the brothers (particularly Shimon and Levi):</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>יהודה אתה יודוך אחיך, מה תל' לו' אתה יודוך אחיך, אלא כך אמ' לו יעקב, יהודה בני גלוי וידוע לפני הקדוש ברוך הוא שהצלתה את יוסף מן המיתה, שאילמלי אתה היו הורגין אותו שמעון ולוי </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>From sefer hasidim on why no one was allowed to tell Yaakov about Yosef still being alive. </p>\n\n<p>תתתתשסא. אמרו שבני יעקב שמו חרם שלא להגיד על מכירת יוםף ואיך יתכן שהקב״ה יסכים והם חוטאים ולמה לא יגיד ליעקב? אלא כך אמרו כיון שמוציא דיבה עלינו ויודע שאנחנו שונאים אותו כי אמר לאבינו מה שלא עשינו והוא אומר שימלוך עלינו וכתיב (שם לז ח) ויוםיפו עוד שנא אתו על חלמותיו ועל דבריו, למה נאמר על דבריו כי היה אומר כיון שאתם חשודים באותם דברים שהיה מביא דיבה אל אביהם אני יודע שאמלוך ואני אמשול וארדה בכם שלא תעשו עוד וחם חשבו כזו מדבר וכך חולם נשכים לד,ורנו ויאמר יהודה כי כיון שאומר שירצה שנהיה לו לעבדים אם יתקיימו באותה מידה נעשה לו ונמכרנו לעבר שנאמר \n(תהלים קה יז) לעבד נמכר יוםף ונמכרנו למרחקים ואם ימלוך לא ימשול בנו בכאן וישבע יוםף שלא ישיב לאביו ולא יניד לא על ידי שליח ולא על ידי כתב בלא רשותינו ואשר אמר צבא השמים משתחוים לו עושה עצמו כנעבד אם כן נשים חרם ברצון הבורא אם רצונו שלא ידע אבינו והסכים  כדי שיהא כפרה לו.</p>\n\n<p>And it's actually Rashi who speaks about Yitzhak knowing prophetically. The Lubavitcher Rebbe answers this question (Likutei Sichot vol. 10 p. 129ff) based on Rashi's assertion (in his commentary on <a href=\"https://www.chabad.org/library/bible_cdo/aid/8232#v=33&showrashi=true\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Miketz 37:33</a>) that Isaac, Jacob's father, prophetically knew that Joseph was alive—but didn't tell Jacob. \"How can I tell him,\" Isaac reasoned, \"when G‑d chooses to keep it a secret from him?\" </p>\n\n<p><strong>Rashi</strong></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><strong>a wild beast has devoured him:</strong> [This means that] the Holy Spirit flickered within him: Potiphar’s wife will ultimately provoke him\n  (Gen. Rabbah 84:19). Now why did the Holy One, blessed be He, not\n  reveal it (the truth) to him? Because they (the brothers)\n  excommunicated and cursed anyone who would reveal [it], and they\n  included the Holy One, blessed be He, with them, but Isaac, however,\n  knew that he was alive [but] he said, “How can I reveal it if the Holy\n  One, blessed be He, does not wish to reveal it to him?” [from Tanchuma\n  Miketz]</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Warming up cold liquid on shabbas\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>There is a concept of ein bishul achar bishul (you can't cook a food more once its cooked already) . This concept applies to dry foods according to all opinions and one would be able to warm such food up without worrying about cooking it. However, with regard to liquids ashkanazim are machmir and hold that there is more cooking that could be done to a liquid.</p>\n\n<p>Many people are aware of this and will not warm up a liquidy food such as a saucy chicken dish on shabbas day. My question is why can't one just pour hot water from an urn (kli rishon) into a kli sheni (empty aluminium pan) and then take the saucy chicken (which is in a smaller aluminum pan) and place it in the kli sheni to warm it up. People do this every shabbas when they pour cold milk into their coffee. Why do people refrain from warming up cold (already cooked) sauce in a kli sheni?</p>\n\n<p>Any time I see this halacha mentioned in a sefer or on a halacha sheet for the rules of warming up, they unequivocally say that warming liquidy foods is assur, but why wouldnt they give such advice? </p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>What you describe is indeed <a href=\"http://halachipedia.com/index.php?title=Infants_on_Shabbat#Feeding_a_baby\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">a common way</a> of re-heating a baby bottle on Shabbat. One places the baby bottle full of cold milk in a cup of hot water until it warms up (although one does not submerges the bottle completely <a href=\"http://www.dailyhalacha.com/m/halacha.aspx?id=792\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">because of <em>hatmana</em></a>).</p>\n\n<p>This might not practically apply to reheating dishes as it would likely require large amounts of hot water.</p>\n\n<p>For the reasons this is not mentioned more often, it could be that publishers of summary halachot are afraid that people will start cooking for real, e.g., putting a plate with warm water on fire left on. The boundaries between permitted/forbidden are delicate and any advice can easily be misinterpreted. Similarly many (but not all) permit reheating a dish with a bit of sauce, i.e., if the goal of reheating is to reheat the dish and not the sauce, and if the sauce is a minor part of the dish (see e.g., <a href=\"https://torahmitzion.org/learn/warming-food-shabbat/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a>). But there again this can lead to mistakes and is best discussed with a rav using the specifics of the dish.</p>\n\n\n",

He went through the city, crying out loudly and bitterly, until he came in front of the palace gate; for one could not enter the palace gate wearing sackcloth.\n  ...\n  When Esther’s maidens and eunuchs came and informed her, the queen was greatly agitated. She sent clothing for Mordecai to wear, so that he might take off his sackcloth; but he refused. Thereupon Esther summoned Hathach, one of the eunuchs whom the king had appointed to serve her, and sent him to Mordecai to learn the why and wherefore of it all.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I presume (based on <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Esther.4.2?lang=en&p2=Malbim_on_Esther.5.1&lang2=he\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Malbim</a>) that the reason Mordechai came to the palace gate was to make Esther aware of the decree, and discuss how to respond. Previously (chapter 2) Mordechai had spoken directly with Esther. Yet now, by refusing the clothing she sent, Mordechai and Esther are forced to communicate through a messenger. </p>\n\n<p>This seems to pose a security problem (what if the messenger betrays them, or is captured and forced to reveal his message etc.). All of this does not seem to be in the best interest of Mordechai and Esther and does not seem to be in keeping with Mordechai's intent in going to the palace gate in the first place. </p>\n\n<p>I am unaware of any halachic reason that Mordechai could not switch his clothing (I assume this situation qualifies as pikuach nefesh) and therefore I ask - Why didn't Mordechai accept the clothes sent by Esther?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>Malbim (<a href=\"http://mg.alhatorah.org/Full/Esther/4.4#e1n7\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Esther 4:4</a>) addresses this directly by saying that Mordechai felt that it would have been inappropriate for him to stop his supplication/prayer at that point:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>ולא קבל כי לא רצה להפסיק רגע מתחנונים, שזה כעוזב בטחונו מה' וסומך על עזרת בשר</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>He also addresses the \"security concern\" in the very next verse (<a href=\"http://mg.alhatorah.org/Full/Esther/4.5#e1n7\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">4:5</a>), saying that Esther knew Hathach to be trustworthy:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>...שלחה להתך שהיה אצלה נאמן רוח מכסה דבר, כי הוא מסריסי המלך אשר העמיד לפניה ביחוד ואיש סודה...</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The Maharal (Or Chadash 4:4) answers this question by noting that had Mordechai accepted the clothing from Esther, it would have appeared that he tore his clothing and wore sackcloth only to attract Esther's attention and make contact with her.  However, he wished to show that he was genuinely mourning over all that had taken place/doing Teshuva (as well as likely inspiring others to do the same).  The direct quote is:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>ומרדכי לא קבל שא\"כ יהיה נראה שלא לבש השק מתחלה רק כדי להודיע לאסתר את הצרה ולא בשביל אבל וצער עתה יהיה נראה כי לבישת השק הוא בשביל התשובה</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Maharal continues by adding that had he removed the sackcloth, it would have shown that he was withdrawing or removing himself from his Teshuva in some way.  He discusses this theme at length, but his conclusion is:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>ואם היה מסיר השק אשר היה ראוי להיות דבק בבשרו היה נראה כי הוא סר מן התשובה לגמרי לכך לא היה רוצה להסיר שק. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>(Note that according to Ralbag (<a href=\"http://mg.alhatorah.org/Full/Esther/4.4#e1n7\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Esther 4:4</a>), Esther sending Mordechai the clothing had nothing to do with him being able to enter the palace and speak to her, and it was only from his refusal to accept them that Esther knew that he was upset about something.)</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Is Hashem polite?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>This question might be a bit weird, but here's what inspired it.</p>\n\n<p>In an internet forum I frequent, someone posted a wall of text (that is, a long post without any line breaks or paragraphs). I pointed out that posting a wall of text is impolite. He replied, \"well, if walls of text are impolite, then the whole Torah is impolite.\"</p>\n\n<p>This lead me to think - So G-d and the Torah are impolite, what of it? We can think of many instances where G-d's actions or words can be considered impolite. When you rule the entire universe you have the luxury of not being polite.</p>\n\n<p>On the other hand we were made in His image, so if we consider politeness to be a virtue, we should expect G-d to exhibit it as well.</p>\n\n<p>So now I'm curious - should G-d be polite, is he, and do these questions even make sense?</p>\n\n<p><strong>Addendum</strong>, particularly with response to @DanF:</p>\n\n<p>I should clarify that the point of the other person in the forum wasn't to show that the Torah is impolite. Quite the opposite - he was trying to say that the Torah is obviously polite, and the Torah is a wall of text (DanF points out this isn't actually the case), so walls of text cannot be impolite.</p>\n\n<p>It was I who used this opportunity to idly wonder whether G-d and the Torah should actually be expected to be polite.</p>\n\n<p>The story about that forum clearly was not directly relevant to the question, but it was my attempt (unsuccessful, apparently) to establish the background for the question and clarify what it is that I mean.</p>\n\n<p>Ultimately it was an open-ended question about an issue I found interesting, which I hoped could expand a bit my understanding about such matters. I recognize that SE isn't the best fit for such questions, but I couldn't think of a better place to ask.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>One cannot define God as being either polite or un-polite, both attributes would limit Him and he is by definition unlimited.

It says to show first the congregation on the right (meaning you turn to your left), then the congregation on your left (meaning, you turn to your right) then those in front and finally, those in back.</p>\n\n<p>In most shuls, and, I assume O.C. is mentioning this arrangement, the bimah is in the middle of the shul. Most hagbah lifters open the Torah just prior to their lifting it. Thus, the people in the back of the shul (behind him) are getting the first look.</p>\n\n<p>Maybe, I am missing something in O.C.'s phrasing, here. But, the only way I can see avoiding showing the people in the back first is that the lifter would have to lift a closed scroll, turn to his left, and then open the scroll in the air. There are very few people that I have seen who can do this. It's quite difficult. Practically speaking, if one were to strictly follow O.C.'s order, what other way could hagbah be done?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>A simple answer to your final question would be to simply rotate the Sefer Torah on the Bimah by 90 degrees counterclockwise (where the face is the surface that the Torah is resting on), and then unroll and lift it from the right side of the Bima (where a Gabbai usually stands), directly showing those on the right, and then turning around.</p>\n\n<p>Another possibility is that \"showing\" a particular side of the room could mean holding it open for them to look at, rather than quickly moving it through their sightlines.</p>\n\n<p>In regards to the entire order of the Shulchan Aruch (which is based on <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Tractate_Soferim.14.14?lang=he&with=all&lang2=he\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Maseches Sofrim 14:14</a>), אנציקלופדיה תלמודית כרך ח, הגבהה ב notes 2 approaches to Hagbah, as discussed in the Sheyarei Kenesses Hagedolah (OC 134:7, Hagahos Beis Yosef).  One opinion is that the Magbiah should simply lift and turn around with the Sefer Torah, thus not taking the specific order of the Shulchan Aruch literally.  The other opinion (if I understand it correctly) is that he essentially lifts and flips the Sefer Torah around to show the side with the writing on it to those 4 sides of the room, in order.  This sort of solves the issue because he is simply flipping the side of the Sefer Torah with writing on it, as opposed to turning around. (Presumably the Magbiah would do this by originally pulling the left wooden support of the sefer up in the air, and only once that had been lifted would he lift the right side upright. Following this, he would be required to awkwardly twist his arms in order to show the Sefer Torah to the other sides of the room.)  This sounds very complex, and at least as problematic as opening and closing it in the air.</p>\n\n<p>Here is the text of the אנציקלופדיה תלמודית, mainly quoting the Sheyarei Kenesses Hagedolah: </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>כשמראה פני הכתב לעם יש סוברים שהמגביה עצמו נשאר עומד במקומו, אלא שהוא מסובב ומחזיר את הס\"ת כדי שפני הכתב יהיו לעם העומדים בצד ימינו, ואחר כך הופכו ומראה פני הכתב לעם שבצד שמאלו, ומחזיר לפניו והופך אחורי הכתב נגד פניו כדי שהעומדים לצד מזרח יראו הכתב, ואחר כך הוא מחזיר הכתב נגד פניו שיראו העומדים לצד מערב, ויש סוברים שהמגביה עצמו הוא סובב לכל הצדדים, וכן המנהג.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>See also Rav Menashe Klein (Mishneh Halachos 11:103), who asks a related question and discusses this at length.</p>\n\n\n",

All such cases I've heard about are liberal/progressive communities, not Orthodox.</p>\n\n<p>As I understand it, a child with these kinds of limitations is not <em>halachically</em> responsible for the <em>mitzvot</em>, so his 13th birthday does not mark a transition in that regard -- he's not actually <em>bar mitzvah</em>.  As a practical matter, the child in the cases I've heard about is not capable of saying <em>b'rachot</em> and cannot be a <em>sh'liach</em> for the congregation, so the things usually done by the boy at the service are not options.  I heard of one (liberal) congregation where the child pressed a button to play back a recording of somebody else saying <em>b'rachot</em>; I don't know what the <em>halachic</em> issues there would be (if done on a weekday).</p>\n\n<p>So I'm aware of some of the <em>halachic</em> issues, and I'm also aware that parents, at least the ones I know, usually want to mark the same milestones for their children that everybody else does.

I've seen several Bar Mitzvah affairs done on Shabbat for cerebral palsy kids and those with all kinds of disabilities.</p>\n<p>I have a close friend who has an autistic son. (IMO, I pray that no one should ever have to deal with this disability. In some ways, it's worse than dealing with a child with cancer.) He is somewhat verbal, but, he understands little of what's happening.</p>\n<p>As I understand from my friend, on Shabbat, they had him come up to the bimah while someone else got the aliyah, and he kissed the Torah (with some help / prompting.) At the end of shul, he sang a song (for an autistic kid, BTW, he has almost perfect pitch and an angelic voice. You never know what talents hide, there!)</p>\n<p>This is besides a full Bar Mitzvah \"feast\" that they made the next day with speeches, singing, dancing and the works. It was a true <em>simcha</em>.</p>\n<p>What I mentioned for autism I've seen similarly done with cerebral palsy, cripples, blind and my son who is deaf. (Halachic issues involving <em>cheresh</em> may apply to Torah reading, etc.) The point is that, indeed, these are quite frequent among Orthodox shuls, at least in my neighborhood.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Deaf and hard-of-hearing people, fortunately, face fewer shul inclusion challenges today than about 15 years ago. There seems to be a general halachic consensus that profoundly deaf people may read from the Torah. (Definition of <em>cheresh</em> in the Gemarah is disputed, but has generally been interpreted as \"deaf-mute\" and the thinking, then, was that they were non-intelligent.) Today, many deaf people wear cochlear implants, and there's a general halachic agreement that an implant produces immediate sound equivalent to regular hearing.</p>\n<p>You may want to view this article published by <a href=\"https://www.ou.org/news/ous_our_way_announces_signs_of_bar_mitzvah_a_handbook_for_jewish_deaf_and_h/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Our Way</a>, a division of OU. As my son has been deaf for many years, we have been members of this wonderful group. For his Bar Mitzvah, we had him read maftir and the haftarah on Shabbat. As his Bar Mitzvah occurred during Chanukah (well, we postponed the celebration a few weeks to coincide with Chanukah, actually,) on Sunday morning, he read the double Rosh Hodesh / Chanukah Torah portion. If I recall correctly, a JSL (\"Jewish\" sign language. It's mainly ASL, but they translate Hebrew, davening an religious terminology; quite fascinating!) interpreter volunteered to interpret the prayers and reading for the few other deaf that attended on Sunday.</p>\n<p>The practical halachot of <em>cheresh</em> today are somewhat complex. But, point is that not only are Orthodox Bar Mitzvah's done by deaf kids, but, they really try hard to include the hearing by publishing a Bar Mitzvah symbol booklet. If you've never been at a mainly \"deaf\" prayer service, as a hearing person, I can tell you that YOU would need a \"reverse\" ASL interpreter.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><a href=\"http://www.jdcc.org/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=3171:from-asl-interpreters-to-service-dogs-orthodox-shuls-trying-to-be-more-inclusive&catid=1308:jewish-deaf-tidbits&Itemid=101\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">This article</a> cites the numerous Orthodox shuls throughout the U.S. that accommodate various disabilities in various ways.

(Adam Starr) This story is\nsponsored by the Orthodox Union.</p>\n<p>Erik Bittner can pinpoint the exact moment he felt his son with autism\nwas truly included at his family’s Orthodox synagogue, Shaarei\nTefillah in Newton, Massachusetts. It was a Shabbat morning and the\ngabbai – the sexton orchestrating services — called Bittner’s\n24-year-old son, Nathan, up for an aliyah, to recite the blessings\nover the Torah.</p>\n<p>“Nathan whizzed through the brachot and he was effusive in his\ngratitude for going up there,” Bittner recalled, using the Hebrew word\nfor blessings. “He shook everyone’s hand. It was a touching emotional\nmoment.”</p>\n<p>But the next week when Nathan showed up late and afterward asked why\nhe didn’t get an aliyah, the gabbai responded: “I only give aliyahs to\npeople who show up on time.”</p>\n<p>Bittner wasn’t upset; on the contrary. He was pleased his son was\ntreated like anybody else.</p>\n<p>“Real inclusion means those with special needs are held to the same\nstandards as everyone else — as long as those standards do not exclude\nthem,” Bittner said.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>Having a severely autistic son, we had a mini concert with Yaakov Shwekey, who is his favorite singer.

It is largely based on feeds that automatically takes material written by news services and bloggers who are not shomer Shabbos (but no one is writing specifically for the app). The app does make a little money from ads, but I'm not selling anything per-se. The app has actually been live for quite a while - it's tough to tell, but at the moment most users are probably not Jewish.</p>\n\n<p>Is it permissible to include such feeds as some material is inevitably written on Shabbos and inevitably some users will 'download' this material before shabbos ends? Note that the material will only reach the user's phone when the (not-necessarily-Jewish) user decides to load the app.</p>\n\n<p>Additionally, are there any issues in providing such content with regards to any Lashon Hora contained within?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 3)\n\n<p><strong>The topic of operating apps/sites on Shabbat is complex</strong>, an entire book (<a href=\"http://www.feldheim.com/commerce-and-shabbos.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Commerce and Shabbos</a>) was written on it by R Yosef Y Kushner.</p>\n\n<p>In general it is permitted to write an app that will maybe be used by Jews on Shabbat (and there are thousands like this of course). R Shlomo Aviner writes that, regarding \"Do not place a stumbling block\", if one is uncertain that the person will transgress the Halachah, we are \"tolim\" (literally \"hanging\" on the assumption) that he will not violate it (Mishnah <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Mishnah_Gittin.5.9?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Gittin 5:9</a>) (see bottom of <a href=\"http://www.ravaviner.com/2017/12/short-sweet-text-message-q-341_19.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a>).</p>\n\n<p>We also know that</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>some sites operated by religious Jews (e.g., B&H Photo) are operating on Shabbat with the commerce function disabled (i.e., you can browse but not buy)</li>\n<li>some sites operated by religious Jews (e.g., artscroll) shut down entirely</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>R Kushner explicitly addresses a number of relevant topics for your app</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Operating an e-commerce website on Shabbat</strong> (p. 183): he writes that according to the overwhelming majority of <em>poskim</em>, a Jewish-owned website may remain open on Shabbat, for reasons similar to those explained <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/a/67229/11501\">here</a> (which would explain B&H)</li>\n<li><strong>Profiting from online advertising on Shabbat</strong> (p. 200): permitted if the earnings generated from ads run on Shabbat are received by the Jewish owner together with the money earned from advertising during the weeks</li>\n<li><strong>Operating a website used by a majority of Jews</strong> (p. 190): he writes  that it would be better to avoid leaving the website open on Shabbat (which would explain artscroll) - I understand this is not your case but wanted to be complete</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>So there are likely to be <em>poskim</em> who will permit or prohibit based on the specifics of the case. But you really need to speak to a competent rav to review the specifics and get a personal ruling. The above might serve as a helpful review of some of the sources.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p><strong>Regarding <em>lashon hara</em> on the Internet</strong>, there is <a href=\"http://a.co/bo5ADXC\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">a book</a> for this as well :-> (but I don't have it), this <a href=\"http://blogs.timesofisrael.com/book-review-false-facts-and-true-rumors-lashon-hara-in-contemporary-culture/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">review</a> (bottom) mentions it explicitly addresses issues relevant to your question.</p>\n\n<p>Since newspapers are definitely constrained by the laws of <em>lashon hara</em> (see e.g., bottom of <a href=\"http://www.daat.ac.il/daat/english/journal/oppenheimer-1.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a>), it stands to reason you will need rabbinic guidance on your app as well.</p>\n\n<p>R Dovid Genish  <a href=\"https://www.hidabroot.com/article/135129/Media-Gossip\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">writes</a></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Newspapers certainly contain much lashon hara, and as the Chofetz\n  Chaim makes clear, the prohibition includes not writing negatively\n  about other individuals, groups or communities. Az Nidberu (14:64)\n  discusses the issue of liability – is it the journalist who has\n  transgressed lashon hara or the publisher/vendor?</p>\n  \n  <p>His conclusion is that the writer is certainly guilty, for even though\n  at the time of writing he did not tell anyone his lashon hara, once\n  his words are published he has transgressed retroactively. <strong>On the\n  other hand, the publisher or vendor is by and large not liable since\n  he has no intention to spread lashon hara – he merely earns his\n  livelihood by selling newspapers, but does not specifically intend to\n  damage others. Nevertheless, he recommends that one should stay as far away from such newspapers as possible.</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Last, halachayomit <a href=\"http://www.halachayomit.com/lashon.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">writes</a> in a way that would make it challenging to automatically republish articles from \"non-kosher sources\"</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>I also contacted Arutz-7, a radio station here in Israel. One of the\n  founders of this station is a Rosh Yeshiva (dean of a Yeshiva), and I\n  believe that they sincerely try to avoid lashon hara. The following is\n  the reply that I received from [them]</p>\n  \n  <p>Rabbi Zalman Melamed - the Rosh Yeshiva of Yeshivat Beit El, Rabbi of\n  Beit El, and one of the founders of Arutz-7 - is the rabbinic\n  authority of Arutz-7. <strong>His guiding principle is, first of all, that\n  something that is already known (public knowledge) can not always be\n  publicized - as publicizing it further is at least avak lashon hara (a\n  statement which is not lashon hara itself, but will cause lashon hara\n  to be spoken).</strong></p>\n  \n  <p>[...]</p>\n  \n  <p>Equally obviously, the above rules out all sorts of gossip columns,\n  which have absolutely no place in a Torah publication. Similarly,\n  crime stories usually should not have any names mentioned. Even\n  political figures, who are often justifiably criticized based on the\n  above principle of \"benefit to the public,\" should not be mentioned by\n  name in cases that can bring no such benefit - such as how many times\n  he was divorced, or the like. There have been several cases when we\n  have specifically left out names, even though in a \"normal\" newspaper\n  they would have been mentioned totally matter-of factly\".</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

(Ask a rav about this, because a picture is viewed much later, so I don't know if this is called \"benefit\".) At any rate, to solve the doubt, wait the minimal 1/2 hour or until the candles are out. After that, light as many menorot as you wish without a bracha and take all your pictures. Feel free to upload one, here.</p>\n\n\n",

For Jewish women the prohibition is deduced from the commandment not to follow the customs of Egypt (Leviticus 18: 3; see also Mishneh Torah -Issurei Biah 21.8), but it seems difficult to think that this prohibition is universal, because it can not be known by the Gentiles from the analysis of the written Torah, but only through the exact  knowledge of how the oral Torah interprets precisely the textual step \"customs of Egypt\";</p></li>\n<li><p>Is it correct to say that rape (including that vomiting conduct that responds to the name of pedophilia) falls within the noahide prohibition of theft?</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Another aspect on which I would like a clarification concerns the conduct of the Gentile husband to his Gentile wife. I explain it better.</p>\n\n<p>If a married man goes to bed with an unmarried woman, he does not commit adultery; if the man is a Gentile, the prohibition of Deuteronomy 23,18, limited to the Israelites, can not be applied to him; now, in the Italian legal system, as I believe in that of many other countries, the spouses are bound to the duty of mutual fidelity (article 143 of the Italian Civil Code). When a man and a woman get married in Italy, and this even in cases where this happens before a religious authority such as a rabbi or a Christian priest, marriage can produce legal effects for the Italian State only if the spouses declare to having acknowledged the rights and duties provided for them by Italian Law, then also the aforementioned provision on the duty of mutual fidelity.</p>\n\n<p>The nohahide prohibition of theft includes, if I have understood well, also the contractual fraud; now, marriage in Italian law is not properly a contract, but it is in any case a legal transaction, so I hypothesize that the aforesaid prohibition of contractual fraud can also be applied by analogy to marriage. If the wife allows her husband to go to bed with an unmarried woman, I do not believe there are problems on the level of the Noahide Laws; but what happens if this consent is missing, and this is if the husband has a sexual intercourse with an unmarried woman without the consent of his wife? Does not violate the prohibition of theft for having committed a fraud of a contractual nature?</p>\n\n<p>To be clear, I consider morally reprehensible the conduct of a husband who betrays his wife even in the absence of adultery, but is it an illicit conduct according to the Noahides Laws, in the presence of a mutual fidelity obligation established by the Law of the State?</p>\n\n<p>Excuse me for the length of the question, but the issue is very complex for a son of Noah like me.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>Hello and welcome to our site. This would best be broken into multiple individual questions.</p>\n\n<p>For details on Noahide laws, it's best to find a personal rabbi; additionally, consider a book like Rabbi Aaron Lichtenstein's Seven Laws of Noah on the details of the laws.</p>\n\n<p>The basic starting point is Maimonides' Ch. 9, Laws of Kings:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>ז  [ה] שש עריות אסורות על בני נוח--האם, ואשת האב, ואשת איש, ואחותו מאימו, וזכור, ובהמה:  שנאמר \"על כן, יעזוב איש, את אביו\" (בראשית ב,כד), זו אשת אביו; \"ואת אימו\" (שם), כמשמעה; \"ודבק באשתו\" (שם), ולא באשת חברו; \"ודבק באשתו\", לא בזכור; \"והיו לבשר אחד\" (שם), להוציא בהמה חיה ועוף שאין הוא והם בשר אחד; ונאמר \"אחותי בת אבי היא--אך, לא בת אימי; ותהי לי, לאישה\" (בראשית כ,יב).</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>... </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>יג  [ט] בן נוח חייב על הגזל, בין שגזל גוי בין שגזל ישראל.  ואחד הגוזל, או הגונב ממון, או גונב נפש, או הכובש שכר שכיר וכיוצא בו--אפילו פועל שאכל שלא בשעת מלאכה--...</p>\n  \n  <p>There are six types of forbidden relations for a Noachide: a mother, stepmother, a woman married to someone else, a maternal sister, a male, and an animal. ...</p>\n  \n  <p>A Nochaide is liable for theft from anyone, Jew or not. This applies whether he robbed without the victim's knowledge [e.g. pickpocketing] or with it [e.g. holding him up at gunpoint]; it includes kidnapping, not paying a worker's wage, or even for a crop worker to eat of the crops when he's not on the job [and thus entitled to].</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>So to answer your questions:</p>\n\n<p>A.) Female-female relations appear to not be on the list. (Though if I recall correctly, Rabbi Lichteinstein's book may discuss other opinions.)</p>\n\n<p>B.) You are correct that rape is included in \"theft\"; the commentaries on <a href=\"http://bible.ort.org/books/pentd2.asp?ACTION=displaypage&BOOK=1&CHAPTER=34\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Genesis Ch. 34</a> address this, as Shechem is a non-Jew who commits rape there and is punished for it -- the Bible says <em>and such a thing would not be done!</em>.</p>\n\n<p>C.) A man cheating on his wife with a non-married woman: Noachide law (like Judaism until a thousand years ago) never banned a man from having more than one wife; and Maimonides opens his Laws of Marriage by saying explicitly that prostitution was allowed before the Jews received the Torah, i.e. it's not prohibited by Noachide law; he never there discusses whether the customer was married. So to say that cheating on one's wife by having a girlfriend on the side is all-out \"theft\" because of their contractual agreement is ... probably too far a stretch. Maimonides' examples were all monetary losses. It's disgusting behavior, and Noachide societies can and should enact all sorts of laws to keep society from falling apart, so by all means punish the fellow; but it would be hard to say it's punishable as \"theft.\"  (Though if he now owes her money because he cheated on her, to not pay that money would be theft.)</p>\n\n\n",

I find the cooking laws of Shabbat quite confusing and I'd like to get a simplified understanding of it, if possible.</p>\n\n<p>Apparently, pouring hot water from a <em>kli rishon</em> (first vessel) into a <em>kli sheini</em> (second vessel) suffices for it not to be considered \"cooking\".</p>\n\n<p>As I understand, \"cooking\" is defined as \"yad soledet bo\" - i.e., if the temperature is so hot that your hand would flinch from the heat, it is considered cooking.</p>\n\n<p>My question on all this. I think most people would agree that even by the time you pour that hot water into the 2nd vessel, it is still <em>yad soledet bo</em>. So, why does the <em>kli sheini</em> technique work?</p>\n\n<p>Also, It seems that the vessel you pour the liquid into should be the biggest factor in temperature change. If one poured the liquid into an ice cold glass beer mug, it would cool much more quickly than if it were poured into a hot aluminum cup that was left on the blech.</p>\n\n<p>If you would, feel free to edit the question if I got any of these concepts way off. My main question is regarding the idea of the <em>kli sheini</em>.</p>\n\n<p>I request that your answer be in \"layman's terms\". Of course, sourcing is a big help in case I want to research further, but, please try to offer a \"simplified\" English source.

Cooking food in a pot that's rapidly cooling off is not how it was done in the Mishkan. (By Basar Bechalav it's much more complicated. See <a href=\"http://www.ohrreuvenapp.com/shiur/21793\" rel=\"noreferrer\">this Shiur from Rabbi Rudinsky</a>.)</p>\n\n<p>Please note that these laws are very complex and have a lot of exceptions and disagreements.</p>\n\n<p>For example according to the Chayei Adam 59:6 (which <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Shulchan_Arukh,_Orach_Chayim.318.5?lang=bi&p2=Mishnah_Berurah.318.48&lang2=bi\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Mishna Berura 318:48</a> agrees with) if the food is hot enough to scald you it will still cook.</p>\n\n<p>Additionally, the Maharshal (Yam Shel Shlomo Chullin 8:71) rules that solids remain a Kli Rishon after being transferred to another dish because the new dish isn't enveloping it and cooling it off the same way a liquid is enveloped by it's surroundings.</p>\n\n<p>This is a very complex question and there is much more to say, but for purposes of brevity we'll leave it here and if you have any additional questions post them in the comments.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>The Chazon Ish explains it like this see <a href=\"http://www.eretzhemdah.org/Data/UploadedFiles/SitePages/3304-sFileRedir.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here, p 9</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>חזון איש אורח חיים סימן נב אות יט</p>\n  \n  <p>לא מצינו מקור לחלק בין שני לשלישי,\n  ואם דברים מתבשלים בשני,מתבשלים לישי,ואין הדבר תלוי אלא בחם המים,שיהיו\n  חמים שהיד סולדת בהם ...ועל הרוב אין כלי שלישי יד סולדת,לכן הקילו</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>In my words:\nNormally, the walls of the vessels cool the contents such that a keli shlishi does not have a  temperature above yad soledes bo and therefore nothing cooks in a  keli shlishi. (This is taken on as the norm by most poskim.)</p>\n\n<p>The Chazon Ish insists that the “numbering” of the keli is not what matters – the temperature determines whether something cooks or not. </p>\n\n<p>I see that this information is available here, <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/9723/where-does-the-concept-of-a-kli-shlishi-come-from\">Where does the concept of a Kli Shlishi come from?</a> .</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Confusing Tes with Pei\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>The Gemara (Shabbos 103a) gives a list of letters that should be written very carefully to avoid being mixed up with other letters:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>\"וכתבתם שתהא כתיבה תמה שלא יכתוב אלפין עיינין עיינין אלפין ביתין כפין כפין ביתין גמין צדין צדין גמין דלתין רישין רישין דלתין היהין חיתין חיתין היהין ווין יודין יודין ווין זיינין נונין נונין זיינין טיתין פיפין פיפין טיתין כפופין פשוטין פשוטין כפופין מימין סמכין סמכין מימין סתומין פתוחין פתוחין סתומין פרשה פתוחה לא יעשנה סתומה סתומה לא יעשנה פתוחה\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>While some of these letter pairs look alike (or in some cases according to Rashi, sound the same), others are extremely confusing.  So my question is, how do Pei and Tes look like each other?  (This could be asked about Gimmel and Tzadi as well, feel free to comment on that pair if you with.)</p>\n\n<p>(Note: I heard a Chiddush in the name of Rav Yaakov Kamenetsky,but I want to hear what others suggest first, as well as to see if others have heard this Chiddush before.)</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 5)\n\n<p><img src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/TlUj9.jpg\" alt=\"hand drawn letter tet with colored segments\"></p>\n\n<p>Here are three ways this Gemara is understood in Rishonim.</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p>The Yereim argues that the problem is if you add the green segment, then the non-blue parts make up a Pei, and that's a problem even though it's only part of a letter looking like another letter. This opinion gets quoted a bunch through to the Acharonim, but it's quite a difficult position since a) lots of letters have parts that look like other letters (eg. Hei has a Dalet in it), and b) there are lots of very old traditions of writing a special \"curly\" Tet (לפופה) which clearly looks Pei-like.</p></li>\n<li><p>The Rosh quoting Rabbenu Tam argues that the problem is if you were to rotate the letter counter-clockwise 90 degrees, then even without the green segment the letter would be invalid since it would be a Pei. According to this the pink segment is essential to the letter (assuming a Pei needs its dot to be bent inwards as usual).</p></li>\n<li><p>The Ramban argues that the problem is to be careful to attach the orange segment to the blue segment since if they split then you end up with two separate Kosher letters: Zayin and Pei. According to this the green segment might be an essential part of the form of a Tet (assuming a Pei needs its dot to be bent inwards as usual).</p></li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>In short, everyone requires the blue and orange sections in a Tet. Option one allows the pink section but prohibits the green section. Option two requires the pink section and allows the green section. Option three requires all sections.</p>\n\n<p>You are right that none of these answers are super convincing. One argument I've seen defending option 1 from the obvious questions it presents (and I think this argument can be extended interestingly to option 3), is that the concern isn't just that a part of the Tet will look like a Pei, but rather the letter will be written in a way (perhaps with an extended base) such that a child will think it's a Pei which is bumping into something else. We use this sort of metric in other contexts such as to determine if two touching letters can be split without violating Chak Tokhot or if a Lamed poking into a Dalet has formed a Hei. According to this, even the green part is acceptable according to option 1 as long as overall the letter is clearly a Tet. (See R' Kalman Hershlag's discussion of this in an appendix to his book <em>Hasetumah Shebestam</em>.)</p>\n\n<p>Option 2 is also a bit odd since although we have examples of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rigid_transformation\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">rigidly transformed</a> letters in the traditions of \"<a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/a/18405/759\">strange letters</a>\" (such as <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/q/3788/759\">Gen 3:24</a> or <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Rashi_on_Genesis.11.32\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Gen 11:32</a>), they are certainly not common mistakes that the Gemara would need to warn us about them. This option might make more sense if we consider a slightly tipped letter which could occur in somewhat sloppy handwriting. Consider if this image courtesy of @<a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/users/2840/loewian\">Loewian</a> is a Tet or a Pei:</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/9usmo.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/9usmo.png\" alt=\"tipped letter\"></a></p>\n\n<p>Finally, it's worth considering simply what could happen if the scribe doesn't pull the left side of the Tet up far enough or alternatively if he tips the end of the Pei up with a bit of flourish. Consider which of the following letters a child would read as Tet and which as Pei:</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/VQ8b4.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/VQ8b4.jpg\" alt=\"series of letters with slightly differently sized left sides\"></a></p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>Rav Yaakov Kamenetsky (<a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=47587&st=&pgnum=179\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=47587&st=&pgnum=179</a>) addresses the above question.  Here is an organized summary of his points:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Tes and Pei don't seem to look alike</li>\n<li>In these cases, the words are written incorrectly in the Gemara.

Also, note that Rambam chooses only ו/י, כ/ב, ד/ר, but not the others, and expects us to know from those examples. Rav Yaakov feels that based on Rambam's style he should have quoted ג/צ as well (but not א/ע because those don't look the same, only sound the same).</p>\n\n<p>Based on all of the above, he comes to the following conclusion (as hinted to by the Rambam). <strong>The Hebrew letters Tes and Pei are not what the Gemara is referring to!  The Gemara is referring to the Greek letters Theta and Phi</strong>, which do looked very similar back then, and are still quite similar even in today's version of Greek letters (they are basically a circle with some line through it, as shown in this chart).</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/j5prC.gif\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/j5prC.gif\" alt=\"Chart of Greek Alphabet\"></a></p>\n\n<p>(He also suggests that Gamin and Tzadin are Greek letters, but again, this question focuses on Tes and Pei.)</p>\n\n<p>Therefore, the Rambam begins by talking about that Greek is lost, and as a result does not quote the Greek letters that were in the Gemara.  The word פיפין must be used because a Hebrew word always begins with a Dagesh, so in order to signify the soft \"PH\" sound, it doubles the Pei.  (Similar answers are given for Gamin and Tzadin as well.  See the actual piece inside for more details, as well as other proofs, notes, and attempted answers.)</p>\n\n<p>ראוי לאמרו, ושפתיים ישק!</p>\n\n<p>For the sake of Emes, I will be posting another answer below with my understanding of the Rambam (what I believe to be the simple Peshat), as well as some other points worth considering.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>The Rambam quotes this Gemara in Hilchos Tefillin 1:19 (shown in the previous answer with a link). There he neglects to mention Pei and Tes, because he assumes that you will understand the idea from the other examples given.  However, in 7:8, Rambam speaks about being careful when writing the curly Pei letter, likely due to this Gemara, lest it get stretched to look like a Tes, something which was suggested without a source in @DoubleAA's comprehensive answer above.  There is a image in his answer which illustrates this point well. (It is also possible that this Halacha in 7:8 is just intuition, and not related to that Gemara as well.)  </p>\n\n<p>I strongly argue that the letters, despite their slightly different names, must be Hebrew, as we do not find other places where Greek letters are used in similar contexts, rather, they are referred to as \"Yevani\" letters (e.g. Kerisus 5b).  Also, this Beraisa would presumably be discussing Tefillin and/or Mezuzos as well, which according to Rambam there could not be written in Greek anyways.  The list of Hearos on this goes on and on, so if you're still not convinced, check the comment threads.</p>\n\n<p>Feel free to edit this answer for clarity.</p>\n\n\n",

In Breishit 37:28 it says that Midianites came by first, and they sell Yosef to the Yishmaelites who bring him to Egypt. Yet, in Breishit 37:36 it says that the Medanim sold him to Egypt. OK, I saw Rash\"i on 37:28 that says that the brothers sold him to the Ishmaelites and there were multiple sales until he was eventually brought to Egypt.</p>\n\n<p>One \"problem\" is that when Yosef reveals himself to his brothers, is that he says, in Breishit 45:4, \"I am Yosef your brother whom you sold to Egypt.\"</p>\n\n<p>Even according to those commentaries that say that the brothers were responsible for the sale, how does Yosef make this accusation? Yes, apparently, the brothers knew that the Ishmaelites were heading to Egypt (see end of Breishit 37:25 \"...going down to Egypt\".) However, of course, Yosef knew exactly how things happened, and at the end, <em>pshat</em> says that the Medanites wre the ones who brought him to Egypt, not the Ishamelites. So was Yosef accusing his brothers based on original <strong>thought</strong> and intention?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>Rashbam, who writes that the brothers did not even sell Yosef at all (rather the Midianites stole Yosef from the pit and sold him to the Ishmaelites), addresses the potential question from Yosef's accusation of אשר מכרתם אותי מצרימה, and says that Yosef merely meant that their actions enabled the sale.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>ואף על פי אשר כתב אשר מכרתם אותי מצרימה יש לומר שהגרמת מעשיהם סיעה\n  במכירתו</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>If this can explain the situation in a world where the brothers did not sell Yosef at all, it can certainly explain it in a world where the brothers did sell Yosef (albeit not directly to Egypt).</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>Yosef was in the pit and did not know the details as to what happened. Slave dealers would not tell the slaves about anything that was going on until they turned him over to his new master. As far as Yosef was concerned, his brothers threw him into a pit, he was pulled out, and eventually taken to Egypt for sale. He would not have known about any paper transactions along the way. Indeed, as I say in <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/78685/another-reason-for-yosef-not-communicating-with-his-father-yaakov/78836#78836\">Another reason for Yosef not communicating with his father, Yaakov?</a>, he might even have thought that his father had rejected him and accepted the sale.</p>\n\n\n",

However, a month later he realizes that he cannot stop himself from eating pork, no matter how hard he tries.  He then goes to a Beis Din to ask them to be \"Matir Neder\".  Assuming they find Halachic grounds to be Matir this Neder:  </p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Is it appropriate for the Beis Din to be Matir Neder in order to save Reuven from the extra Aveira each time he eats pork?</li>\n<li>Should the possibility (or, according to some, the inevitability) that their Heter will be considered by some as sanctioning the eating of pork be a reason to avoid being Matir it?  </li>\n</ol>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>A similar question is the subject of much discussion in YD 228.  Rav Moshe Stern, the Debreciner Rav,  in <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=888&st=&pgnum=228\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Shu\"t Beer Moshe Chelek Gimel, Siman 163-165</a> (which includes the summary of his answer), was asked about a person who promised never to bring a TV into his house, and now wanted him to be Matir his Neder:  </p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/8CNhJ.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/8CNhJ.png\" alt=\"enter image description here\"></a></p>\n\n<p>Basically his answer is that it is Assur to be Matir such a Neder, and it is based off of his understanding of the Poskim in the Sugya (it's important to see Tur/SA/Rema 128:16 and Nosei Keilim on all of that).  His main decisions are based on the Shu\"t Rivash 43:2 (copied below), although there is some room for Heter in certain cases based off the Shu\"t Rema 103.  All of the discussion revolves around being Matir a Neder not to do a prohibited act, with the classic example being Mesachek Bekubiya, or gambling.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>... אבל שבועה שנעשית למנוע מאסור אין מתירין אותה. ושחוק בקוביא, הנה יש בו אסורא דרבנן, כדאיתא בסנהדרין פרק זה בורר (כ\"ד:). ואפילו לרב ששת דס\"ל התם דליכא אסמכתא בקוביא, מ\"מ דבר מכוער ומתועב ומשוקץ הוא. ורבים חללים הפיל ועצומים כל הרוגיו. ומפורש הוא בירושלמי (נדרים פ\"ה ה\"ד) דמי שנדר שלא לצחוק, אין מתירין אותו. וכן דעת הרמב\"ן ז\"ל במשפט החרם שלו וכ\"כ הרשב\"א ז\"ל בתשובה...</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>After the fact, he brought the Orchos Chaim (Hilchos Shevuos Unedarim), who says that according to Ramban and Semak it is Assur to be Matir a promise not to gamble, and even if he is already gambling, we should fine him and place him in \"Nidui\":</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>...מי שנשבע שלא לשחק בקוביא, אפילו עבר כבר על שבועתו אסור להתיר לו כדי שלא יהיה חוטא נשכר, אלא יש לנדותו ולהבדילו עד שישים קנס עליו ויקבל על עצמו שלא ישב במקום המשחקים...</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Based on the sources brought within and the Pesak above, in our case it would be Assur to be Matir Reuven's Neder not to eat pig.  Both of points 1 and 2 from the question seem to be addressed in the above Teshuva, and the answer is not to be Matir this, for these reasons.</p>\n\n<p>If someone was Matir this Neder, that is a separate Halachic discussion as to whether it is valid, and not the topic of this post.</p>\n\n<p>For MY users that appreciate \"easter eggs\" in Shu\"t Sefarim, it would be worth it to read the final two paragraphs of his Teshuva, <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=888&st=&pgnum=232\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Beer Moshe 165:12</a>.</p>\n\n\n",

The Beur Halacha is very bothered why one would do such a thing on shabbos, given that the munn specifically didn't fall on shabbos. He <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Biur_Halacha.242.1.6\" rel=\"noreferrer\">brings an explanation</a> he likes from the Tosefes Shabbos citing Toras Chaim:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>והוא לפי דשבת בראשית הוא דוגמת שבת שלע\"ל שהוא יום שכולו שבת ולכן אנו עושים כמה דברים בשבת זה דוגמתו היינו לאכול בשר ודגים נגד סעודת שור הבר ולויתן ומקדשין על היין נגד היין המשומר בענביו לצדיקים לע\"ל...ולכך שפיר יש לעשות בשבת זכר <strong>למן ההוא</strong> [תוספות שבת]׃</p>\n  \n  <p>The reason is that shabbos is a sneak peek at the shabbos of Olam Haba, which is a day that is entirely shabbos. Therefore we do many things on our shabbos similar to that of the future Shabbos. Meaning, we eat meat and fish corresponding to the Shor HaBar and the Leviasan and we say kiddush on wine corresponding to the wine that is preserved for the tzaddikim in the future... therefore it is fitting to [eat pashtidah] on shabbos, commemorating <strong>that munn</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Even though he doesn't explain it, it sounds like he is saying there will be munn in the world to come (although the word זכר seems awkward with this usage). I haven't heard of this concept before and I am wondering if this is something the Toras Chaim developed or is there an earlier source for munn in Olam haba? Not that these things are easy to understand but I'm also wondering what its purpose will be. Will it be eaten? (Chazal <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Berakhot.17a.12\" rel=\"noreferrer\">say</a> there will be no eating in Olam haba, although what's with the other foods mentioned above I'm not sure).</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 9)\n\n<p>Talmud Bavli (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Chagigah.12b?lang=bi\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Hagigah 12b</a>), from Sefaria:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>ר\"ל אמר שבעה ואלו הן וילון רקיע שחקים זבול מעון מכון ערבות... שחקים שבו רחיים עומדות וטוחנות מן לצדיקים שנאמר (תהלים עח, כג) ויצו שחקים ממעל ודלתי שמים פתח \n  וימטר עליהם מן לאכול וגו'.</p>\n  \n  <p>Reish Lakish said: There are [seven firmaments,] and they are as follows: Vilon, Rakia, Sheḥakim, Zevul, Ma’on, Makhon, and Aravot...

Uma Nishtana in Battei Midrashot Vol. II) which states:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>ומנין שהמן בשחקים והיה טחון ברחיים בשביל צדיקים ובשביל ישראל לעולם הבא שנאמר (תהלים עח) וימטר עליהם מן לאכל ודגן שמים נתן למו</p>\n  \n  <p>From where do we know that that the manna...was ground for the Jews in the World to Come?

Importantly, while printed editions of Hagiga do not specify that the manna for the righteous will be consumed in the messianic era, this is found in manuscripts of the passage, such as Goettingen 3, Munich 6, Munich 6, and Spanish Print (ca. 1480), who state that this will be לעתיד לבא. (Notably Vatican 171 lacks these words, and matches the printed editions).</p>\n\n<p>Also interesting, is a work of a student of Rashba, Torat HaMinha (Sukkot Derasha 83 pg. 742) who states that the Jews in the wilderness were treated to food and dwelling similar to Olam HaBa. The food was the manna, which Hazal state was like one sixtieth of Olam HaBa.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>והטעימן הקדוש ברוך הוא מעין העה\"ב בין במאכל בין במושב. במאכל כמו שאמרנו, וארז\"ל מן אחד מששים מעין העולם הבא </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

What I find interesting is that after he interprets the dream he advises Pharaoh to appoint someone in charge of storing food for the eventual famine. Granted, he doesn't specifically say that HE should be the one in charge.</p>\n\n<p>I'm curious if any commentary may have stated that by giving this advice Yosef was thinking that this was the method to have his initial dream fulfilled. Maybe, he thought that Pharaoh would appoint him the one in charge of distributing the food, and eventually, because of the famine stretching in to Cana'an, his family would have to come and bow to him.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>After a quick look through the Mefarshim (Bereishis 41:33), I don't believe any of them would hold like what you suggest.  <a href=\"http://mg.alhatorah.org/Full/Bereshit/41.33#e0n7\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Almost all commentaries</a> understand Yosef's suggestion to Pharaoh as part of the dream interpretation, and not a suggestion with himself in mind.</p>\n\n<p>However, <a href=\"http://mg.alhatorah.org/Full/Bereshit/41.33#e0n7\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Ramban</a> disagrees and says that Yosef said this opportunistically, and was intending to be the one chosen for this job, although he does not comment on if it was his intention to fulfill his dream through this:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>ואמר יוסף כל זה בעבור שיבחרו אותו כי החכם עיניו בראשו.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>However, I believe that it was just so he could get out of jail and become rich, not to fulfill his dreams.  This is proven by Ramban's understanding of the second Passuk that relates to this question, which is Bereishis 42:9 (<a href=\"http://mg.alhatorah.org/Full/Bereshit/42.9#e0n7\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Mefarshim at this link</a>):</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>וַיִּזְכֹּ֣ר יוֹסֵ֔ף אֵ֚ת הַחֲלֹמ֔וֹת אֲשֶׁ֥ר חָלַ֖ם לָהֶ֑ם וַיֹּ֤אמֶר אֲלֵהֶם֙ מְרַגְּלִ֣ים אַתֶּ֔ם לִרְא֛וֹת אֶת־עֶרְוַ֥ת הָאָ֖רֶץ בָּאתֶֽם׃</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>While many Mefarshim (Rashi and others, see Ramban's quote below) understand this Passuk to mean that he realized that they were now fulfilled (and as a result, this does not <strong>necessarily</strong> imply that he had forgotten the dreams before this), Ramban, again disagrees, and understands it simply that <strong>he had forgotten the dreams until now</strong>, and because he saw almost all of his brothers there, he remembered them, and began planning how to fulfill them <strong>only at this point</strong>. Here is the text of the Ramban:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>ויזכר יוסף את החלומות אשר חלם להם – עליהם, וידע שנתקיימו, שהרי השתחוו לו. לשון רש״י.\n  (והנכון בעיני) [ולפי דעתי שהדבר בהפך] כי יאמר הכתוב כי בראות יוסף את אחיו משתחוים לו, זכר כל החלומות אשר חלם להם. (ואמר בלבו עתה יתקיימו כלם עליכן) [וידע שלא נתקיים אחד מהם בפעם הזאת, כי יודע בפתרונם כי כל אחיו ישתחוו לו בתחילה, מן החלום הראשון: והנה אנחנו מאלמים אלומים, כי ״אנחנו״ ירמוז לכל אחיו אחד עשר, ופעם שנית ישתחוו לו השמש והירח ואחד עשר כוכבים, מן החלום השני, וכיון שלא ראה בנימן עמהם] חשב זאת התחבולה שיעליל עליהם כדי שיביאו גם בנימין אחיו אליו, לקיים (גם החלום האחר שאמר: ואחד עשר כוכבים משתחוים לי, וזה טעם וירדו אחי יוסף עשרה, כי החלום הראשון היה אל העשרה, כי בהם אמר: ויגד אותו לאחיו ויוסיפו עוד שנוא אותו, ולהם אמר: והנה אנחנו מאלמים אלומים, והנה בנימין איננו בכלל הזה, ועתה נתקיים החלום הראשון בהשתחוייתם אליו. והחלום השני לא יוכל להתקיים עד בא בנימין גם אביו.) [החלום הראשון תחילה ועל כן לא רצה להגיד להם אני יוסף אחיכם, ולאמר מהרו ועלו אל אבי וישלח העגלות, כאשר עשה עמהם בפעם השניה, כי היה אביו בא מיד בלא ספק. ואחרי שנתקיים החלום הראשון. הגיד להם לקיים החלום השני. ולולי כן, היה יוסף חוטא חטא גדול לצער את אביו ולהעמידו ימים רבים בשכול ואבל על שמעון ועליו, ואף אם היה רצונו לצער את אחיו קצת, איך לא יחמול על שיבת אביו. אבל את הכל עשה יפה בעתו לקיים החלומות כי ידע שיתקיימו באמת.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>In short, I don't think there are any Mefarshim who hold like the Ramban in 41:33, and argue on the simple understanding of \"and he remembered\" in 42:9.</p>\n\n<p>Feedback welcome!</p>\n\n\n",

I'm thinking, perhaps, yes, because the end of the prayer says <em>refu'at hanefesh</em> - a healing of the spirit / soul.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 7)\n\n<p>One is exempt (from punishment) by extinguishing a flame on Sabbath for the sake of an emotionally ill person (cf.

No one can learn everything. (See e.g. <a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=920&st=&pgnum=364\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Igros Moshe Y.D. 3:115</a> second to last paragraph)</p></li>\n<li><p>People prioritize learning sefarim with more importance/value.</p></li>\n<li><p>The Semag has comparatively low value. With no disrespect meant to the sefer or its author, it is outmatched in every area. As a work of halacha, it is pretty much only useful to someone who is going through every shitah of rishonim. For most people, studying the Shulchan Aruch with commentaries gets them the halacha they need to know. For those a step higher, the Beis Yosef already collects and discusses many of the views of rishonim. If instead of halacha one's focus is on explanations of the Talmud, there are more than enough works of rishonim that were written as commentaries to the Talmud, that someone would not feel the need to turn to the Semag to try to extract a Talmudic explanation. As a \"Sefer Hamitzvos\" it lacks the succinctness of Rambam's Sefer Hamitzvos, and it lacks the \"reasons\" of the Sefer Hachinuch that contribute to the latter's popularity, and it lacks a \"lomdus commentary\" like the Minchas Chinuch.</p></li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>In short (and this is in no way meant as anything negative towards one of the great rishonim) the question should perhaps even be reversed. Why <em>would</em> someone nowadays study the Semag, except as a mere historical curiosity? Unless there is a specific reference that he needs, or a famous Semag shitah in a particular case, the sefer is not very useful to the average Torah-studier. (Of course there are exceptions, and the exceptions probably <em>do</em> study the Semag.)</p>\n\n<p>A final point is that a lot of times it only takes one generation for something to lose popularity. This is because as soon as one generation abandons an area of study, there is no one teaching it to the next generation. The next generation in turn will teach what they have studied and it becomes an ongoing cycle. (I believe this explanation has been advanced for why yeshivos primarily study the same handful of masechtot over and over.)</p>\n\n<p>That it was at one point popular is probably due to the less competition in previous centuries.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Where did the idea of a shul kiddush come from\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>In many communities I have been in around the world after mussaf on shabbat there is often a 'kiddush'. This consists of the Rav of the shul (or some other designee) who makes kiddush and food is served. Often the kiddush is sponsored or provided by someone who is celebrating a simcha. </p>\n\n<p>What is the origin of this practice? </p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>I asked a rabbi about this a while ago. He surmised a few possibilities, none that he knew of having any specific halachic or minhag basis mentioned.</p>\n\n<p>Among many shuls that attracted primarily non-religious members, this was a means to ensure that congregants would at least have some Shabbat meal and some \"connection\" and Shabbat spirit. In some shuls, the meal was a bit more formal and they sang Shabbat songs and the rabbi would give a sermon or short Shabbat-related speech. Some focus was towards \"kiruv\".</p>\n\n<p>Another aspect was purely social. I think this is more of the current trend in Orthodox shuls. I won't discuss the problem that much socializing, sadly, already occurs in shul during davening, but it shouldn't be that way. Thus, the kiddush was meant as a means for people to meet and socialize and food or a \"party\" is a common means or \"supplement\" to socializing / gatherings. (I understand that Church services, similarly have a \"collation\" after services. Probably for a similar reason.)</p>\n\n<p>Some of the comments, above, mentioned hunger. I don't see this as the primary motive for the kiddush, at least among Orthodox crowds. Almost all Orthodox people would have their se'udah at home, anyway. (Yes, there are a few who \"sneak\" into the kiddush room and grab something before others or form their own private \"Schnapps club\" while the service still occurs. I see this as a big problem.) </p>\n\n<p>The presence and sometimes even the type of food at the kiddush has become, now, a \"marketing trend\". People choose a specific shul on Shabbat solely based on the kiddush. IMO, that certainly should not be the main motive. However, for those shuls that may otherwise not gain a minyan, if the kiddush, alone, helps them, then, by all means, it's another reason for doing one.</p>\n\n\n",

At this time Lot is living in S'dom, and it seems reasonable that Avraham knows that.  (Lot was captured when S'dom and 'Amorah were attacked, and Avraham interacts with the king of S'dom.)

He interprets the instruction of the Talmud (<a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/shas.aspx?mesechta=3&daf=13b&format=pdf\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Eruvin 13b</a>) to \"examine (יפשפש) one's deeds\" and \"<em>feel</em> (ימשמש) one's deeds\" to require even checking the motives of his <em>good</em> actions in case there is even a small part of the action that isn't good. This world is compared to darkness (<a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/shas.aspx?mesechta=22&daf=83b&format=pdf\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Bava Metsi'a 83b</a>), and someone who doesn't check his actions won't see things as they truly are.</p>\n<p>The Ramchal instead trusts the <em>intellect</em> (שכל). The difference is, I think, that trusting intuition is to trust yourself <em>before</em> you think about something, while trusting your intellect is to trust yourself after you think about it.</p>\n<p>While the level of ruach hakodesh is at the end of the \"path\" that the Mesilat Yesharim follows, the Ramchal devotes to it only a few sentences in the last chapter. But <a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/shas.aspx?mesechta=22&daf=83b&format=pdf\" rel=\"noreferrer\">chapter 10</a>, on cleanliness (נקיות), is about making your nature \"clean\" of impure motivations. I think it might be better to describe his opinion on following intuition to be that it's a process: Only after reaching a level where your motivations are pure can you begin to trust your intuition. However, he doesn't expand on this last idea very much.</p>\n<p>(A similar idea can be found in the <a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=38230&st=&pgnum=32\" rel=\"noreferrer\">note</a> appended to Tomer Devora (written anonymously, but attributed to <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simcha_Zissel_Ziv\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Rabbi Simcha Zisel Ziv</a> in the book תנועת המוסר vol. 2). The Talmud (<a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/shas.aspx?mesechta=1&daf=33b&format=pdf\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Berachot 33b</a>) asks if fear of heaven is such an easy thing that Moses can say, \"What does God want from you but fear of heaven..?\" The Talmud answers that yes, for Moses it is an easy thing. This provokes the question about how this is relevant to anyone but Moses. His answer is that anyone can gain fear of heaven through thought and effort, and then it would be easy for him just like it was for Moses. And indeed, in his <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kelm_Talmud_Torah\" rel=\"noreferrer\">yeshiva in Kelm</a>, the approach to self-improvement emphasized working on their character traits by slowly improving habits.)</p>\n<hr />\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avrohom_Eliyahu_Kaplan\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Rabbi Avraham Eliyahu Kaplan</a>, in \"שתי דרכים\" in the book בעקבות היראה (<a href=\"http://www.aishdas.org/raek/2derachim.pdf\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Hebrew</a>, <a href=\"http://www.aishdas.org/mussar/raek/2paths/\" rel=\"noreferrer\">English translation</a>) contrasts the approach of self-doubt in musar with self-trust in chasidut.</p>\n<p>Rabbi Kaplan (a student of Slabodka, and clearly leaning towards the side of musar in this difference) describes the thought: \"Maybe I'm fooling myself.\" This is clearly not coming from a point of view that values following one's intuition.</p>\n<p>To quote a telling story from the English translation:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>To illustrate with a story: Chassidim tell over about an encounter between Rav Shmuel of Lubavitch and Rav Yisrael Salanter in the days of summer, at a lodge in Germany.8 Every day they would need to draw water from the well located outside of the lodge. Rav Shmuel would travel with a large group and in a carriage, and Rav Yisrael would go alone, by foot. This gave rise to astonishment among the chassidim. A rumor emerged that Rav Yisrael was not pleased with the Rebbe’s carriage. People began searching for the reason, looking for some prohibition that might be involved in riding in the carriage. They assumed Rav Yisrael might suspect the presence of shatnez (a mixture of wool and linen) in the upholstery. One brazen chassid told this to the Rebbe. Rav Shmuel, in amazement, replied that the Shevus Yakov had declared this permissible. Subsequently when driving to the spa the Rebbe encountered Rav Yisrael going on foot in the same direction. He told the wagon driver to stop, and invited Rav Yisrael to enter the carriage. Jokingly he exclaimed, “It’s better to ride on the Shevus Yakov than to walk by foot!”</p>\n<p>...</p>\n<p>However, it had never even occurred to any of Rav Shmuel’s chassidim that Rav Yisrael was not concerned with possible shatnez in his carriage, but was instead concerned with the question of pride and arrogance.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>He says that the early chasidim knew this, and even spoke about it (he quotes the book Keter Shem Tov for this), but this type of thought slowly left chasidut. It would be interesting to see an answer that spoke about intuition from the other perspective, but I'm not familiar enough with that literature to be able to include that aspect.</p>\n\n\n",

There are\n  contradictory sources on this issue. Many sources indicate that there\n  is no problem with this. Indeed, one of the most widespread methods of\n  collecting charity is precisely to sell honors, such as the Torah\n  readings in synagogue, and even so this is considered to be a\n  perfectly legitimate form of giving.

(Baba Batra 10b)</p>\n  \n  <p>We can resolve this paradox by examining the motivation. A person who\n  is motivated by the desire to help others deserves to be honored for\n  his efforts; it follows that he is perfectly permitted to enjoy the\n  honor, in a modest way. Even a person who seeks only honor but decides\n  to obtain it by helping others is still showing concern, though at a\n  lower level; it is certainly better than trying to gain recognition by\n  pride or excess.</p>\n  \n  <p>But if the original motivation is only to obtain recognition, and\n  there is no concern whatsoever for the needy individual, the gift is\n  not \"charitable\" at all. The donor is exploiting the recipient's state\n  more than he is trying to alleviate it.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Elsewhere R Asher Meir <a href=\"http://www.aish.com/ci/be/48893717.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">writes</a> that</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The prominent medieval authority Rabbi Shlomo Adret writes that\n  honoring donors is not just a gesture to their vanity; it is a mitzvah\n  in and of itself to give honor to those who perform good deeds -\n  including giving charity.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

They, obviously, did not want to be subjected to his dominion. What is the only fail-safe way to assure that Yosef does not achieve his dreams? Killing him.</p>\n\n<p>I think this is the simplest reading of the text. In 37:19 they say </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>הנה בעל החלמות הלזה בא</p>\n  \n  <p>Behold this dreamer is coming</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Then they suggest killing him and they say</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>ונראה מה יהיו חלמותיו</p>\n  \n  <p>And we will see what will become of his dreams</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I think this is best represented by Ralbag's commentary.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>והסכימו ביניהם שיהרגוהו וישליכוהו באחד הבורות ויאמר ליעקב שחיה רעה\n  אכלתהו ואז יראו מה יהיו חלומותיו ר\"ל שאז יתברר להם שלא יתקיימו\n  חלומותיו</p>\n  \n  <p>And they agreed among themselves that they would kill him and cast him\n  into one of the pits and tell Yaakov that an evil animal devoured him,\n  and then they would see what would become of his dreams. Meaning to\n  say, that then it would be certain to them that his dreams would not\n  be fulfilled.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>In fact later in Parshas Mikeitz (התועלת השמיני, The Eighth Lesson) Ralbag mentions that the lesson of this incident is that man should not attempt to thwart the Divine plan. The plan was for Yosef to rule over them, and not only did selling him not thwart this plan, it was the very catalyst that brought the plan to fruition. He compares this to the legend of the founding of Rome, wherein the father of Remus and Romulus dreamed of being overthrown by his children. He banished them to be left to die in the forest, but not only did this not thwart the plan, it enabled it because the children were raised in the forest by a wolf and eventually overthrew their father and founded Rome.</p>\n\n<p>The point here is that the only true way to thwart such a plan is to kill the person involved in it. For as long as the person walks the Earth the plan can still be fulfilled. Thus, the brothers had no choice but to kill Yosef; anything less would not guarantee saving them from his dreams of dominion over them. Indeed once they were convinced by Reuven and Yehuda to not actually kill him but to try to thwart his plan in another way, we see that they did not succeed.</p>\n\n<p>(Ralbag might argue that even killing Yosef would not thwart the Divine plan, either because God could prevent them from killing Yosef, or because He could somehow fulfill it after Yosef is dead.)</p>\n\n<p>From the short account of the attempted killing and then sale of Yosef in Genesis Chapter 37 verses 18-36 there is no textual evidence of nefarious intent or hatred towards Yosef. They were simply doing what they had to do to prevent him from achieving his dreams of dominion over them.</p>\n\n\n",

    "title": "Rambam's View on Attaining Olam Haba with One Mitzvah",
    "content": "# Rambam's View on Attaining Olam Haba with One Mitzvah\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>The last Mishnah in Maseches Makkos states that God wanted to benefit Israel so He gave them many mitzvos.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>ר' חנניה בן עקשיה אומר רצה הקב\"ה לזכות את ישראל לפיכך הרבה להן תורה\nומצות שנ' ה' חפץ למען צדקו יגדיל תורה ויאדיר</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Rambam, in his commentary to that Mishnah, explains this to mean that because there are so many mitzvos it is nigh impossible for someone to never fulfill at at least one properly, and by fulfilling even one mitzvah properly one attains Olam Haba. He also references something he explained elsewhere.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>מיסודות האמונה בתורה שאם קיים האדם מצוה משלש עשרה ושש מאות מצות כראוי\nוכהוגן ולא שתף עמה מטרה ממטרות העולם הזה כלל אלא עשאה לשמה מאהבה כמו\nשבארתי לך הרי הוא זוכה בה לחיי העולם הבא לכן אמר ר' חנניה כי מחמת רבוי\nהמצות אי אפשר שלא יעשה האדם אחת בכל ימי חייו בשלימות ויזכה להשארות\nהנפש באותו המעשה</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yosef_Qafih\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">R. Kafih</a> in the footnotes cites the Mishnah in Kiddushin (1:10) as the \"elsewhere\" that Rambam was referring to. That Mishnah states that anyone who does one mitzvah will get rewarded, will get long life, and will inherit the land.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>כל העושה מצוה אחת מטיבין לו ומאריכין את ימיו ונוחל את הארץ וכל שאינו\nעושה מצוה אחת אין מטיבין לו ואין מאריכין את ימיו ואינו נוחל את הארץ</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Rambam there explains \"doing one mitzvah\" as doing an additional mitzvah that tips the balance of merits vs sins, and he explains the reward as occurring in Olam Haba. This implies that by merely doing one mitzvah one would not gain reward in Olam Haba if his sins still outnumber his merits.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>רצה באמרו כל העושה מצוה אחת שיעשנה יתירה על זכיותיו שהם כנגד עונותיו\nכדי שיהיו זכיותיו מרובין על עונותיו במצוה זו ואמרו כל שאינו עושה מצוה\nאחת כלומר שעונותיו מרובין מזכיותיו ולא עשה מצוה אחת כדי שיהו שקולים\nאלא נשאר עונותיו מרובין מזכיותיו ואמרו מטיבין לו ומאריכין את ימיו\nבעולם הבא וענין נוחל את הארץ ארץ החיים כלומר העולם הבא ונבאר את זה\nבפרק העשירי דסנהדרין</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Furthermore, in his introduction to Perek Cheilek (Sanhedrin Chapter 10) Rambam explains that one can only attain Olam Haba if he upholds the 13 principles of faith delineated there.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>וכאשר יהיו קיימים לאדם כל היסודות הללו ואמונתו בהם אמתית הרי הוא נכנס\nבכלל ישראל וחובה לאהבו ולחמול עליו וכל מה שצוה ה' אותנו זה על זה מן\nהאהבה והאחבה ואפילו עשה מה שיכול להיות מן העבירות מחמת תאבתו והתגברות\nיצרו הרע הרי הוא נענש לפי גודל מריו ויש לו חלק והוא מפושעי ישראל\nוכאשר יפקפק אדם ביסוד מאלו היסודות הרי זה יצא מן הכלל וכפר בעיקר ונקרא\nמין ואפיקורוס וקוצץ בנטיעות וחובה לשנותו ולהשמידו ועליו הוא אומר הלא\nמשנאיך ה' אשנא וכו</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>In sum, we have three differing statements in Rambam's Commentary to Mishnayos on how to attain<sup>1</sup> Olam Haba:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Do any one mitzvah properly (Commentary to Makkos).</li>\n<li>Do an additional mitzvah that leaves one with more merits than sins (Commentary to Kiddushin).</li>\n<li>Uphold the 13 principles of faith (Commentary to Sanhedrin).</li>\n</ol>\n<p>How are these three statements to be reconciled?</p>\n<hr />\n<p><sup>1. This might not be so precise because the first and third statements seem to be discussing how to attain Olam Haba in the first place, while the second statement seems to be referring to increasing one's reward once he already has Olam Haba.</sup></p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>Answer #2 - please read the <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/a/88129/11501\">answer #1</a> first, and then this one, and please provide feedback on any/all of these answers.</p>\n\n<p>The second approach is what I assume R. Kafih is trying to get at, although I have a bit of an issue with it, as I will describe later on.  According to this approach, <strong>PHM Sanhedrin is a given that everyone gets Olam Habah, unless they are listed as an exclusion there</strong>.  PHM Makkos and PHM Kiddushin are discussing the same thing, which is the \"longer\" version of Olam Habah, once they pass Sanhedrin. Rav Chananya Ben Akashya is saying how amazing it is that we can all get \"long\" Olam Habah by just doing one Mitzva (obviously predicated on the fact that you have a Chelek in Olam Habah, because this is talking about \"Olam Habah Level 2\".)</p>\n\n<p>The obvious issue with this is that PHM Makkos and PHM Kiddushin give 2 separate explanations of what \"doing one Mitzvah\" is. PHM Makkos seems to say that doing one Mitzvah alone gets you this Olam Habah, whereas PHM Kiddushin seems to say that you need that one Mitzvah that will bring you to a larger number of Mitzvos relative to your Aveiros.  There are a few answers that could be suggested:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Rambam is still saying that it is very easy to do one more Mitzvah than you require in order to overcome your Aveiros.  This is a bit of a hard read in to PHM Makkos, but you can argue that it is as realistic as Rambam's read of the Mishna in Kiddushin, where he does the exact same thing, especially if he is sending you there from PHM Makkos.</li>\n<li>Rambam understands R' Chanania Ben Akashya as another interpretation of Mishna in Kiddushin, and he understands the Mishna in Kiddushin differently (based on whatever other Gemaros/indications), and he does not \"Pasken\" like R' Chanania ben Akashya.</li>\n<li>Or, we can read PHM Makkos (again, very hard to read) that this is when he has done no aveiros, or that he has done Teshuva for everything else,  (which is essentially the first answer)</li>\n<li>One last possible answer is that Rambam Hilchos Teshuva 3:4 states clearly that PHM Kiddushin is not a numbers game, but a quantity vs. quality game.  This would allow us to read PHM Makkos as saying that if you do a Mitzvah in such a perfect manner, it (almost) always will outweigh your Aveiros, and this is easy to do.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>This approach requires that we understand Rambam to mean that only R' Chananya Ben Akashya thinks that it is impossible for a person not to do one Mitzvah properly, but for us nowadays, not everyone will be able to accomplish this.</p>\n\n<p>Again, none of these is perfect by any means, some are stronger in some ways, some are stronger in other ways.  Please chat about them, and let me know what you think!</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>There are a couple of possible solutions to this question (none that are obvious or completely without question), so I will try to post them over the next few days.  Please provide as much detailed feedback as possible to each one to let me know what you think of it.</p>\n\n<p>Approach number 1 is the shortest/simplest (although not necessarily the best).  Very simply, we can understand that the PHM in Makkos is meant as an Agada that is simply another version of PHM Sanhedrin, which is that each person gets a bit of Olam Haba.  This is motivated by Rambam's comment in Makkos that it is <strong>impossible</strong> to not fulfill at least one Mitzvah (כי מחמת רבוי המצות <strong>אי אפשר שלא יעשה האדם אחת בכל ימי חייו</strong> בשלימות ויזכה להשארות הנפש באותו המעשה), and as a result, everyone gets Olam Habah.  The PHM Kiddushin is for some longer period in Olam Haba, as Rambam says directly there (ואמרו מטיבין לו <strong>ומאריכין את ימיו בעולם הבא</strong>).</p>\n\n<p>There are a number of questions that one can ask on this understanding, some which are easily answered, some which aren't. I would love to chat with all of you in the comments or chat!</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>The contradiction between 1. and 2. seem to form the basis of the <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Tiferet_Yisrael.5?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Maharal's</a> rejection of this Rambam:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>והרמב\"ם ז\"ל פירש במסכת מכות וז\"ל מעיקרי האמונה בתורה כי כשיקיים אדם מצוה מן תרי\"ג מצות כראוי וכהוגן, ולא שתף עם כונתה מכונות העולם אלא שיעשה אותה מאהבה כמו שביארתי לך, הנה זכה לחיי עולם, ועל זה אמר רבי חנניא כי המצות בהיותם הרבה אי אפשר שלא יעשה האדם בחייו אחת מהנה על מתכונתה ועל שלימותה ובעשיית אותה המצוה תחיה נפשו באותו מעשה, וממה שיורה על עיקר זה מה ששאל רבי חנינא בן תרדיון מה אני לחיי עולם הבא והשיב המשיב כלום מעשה בא לידך כלומר עשית מצוה כהוגן והשיב כי נזדמנה לו מצות צדקה על השלימות וזכה בה לחיי עולם הבא עכ\"ל. <strong>ותימה על זה כי איך יסבלו דבריו הא דאמרינן בגמרא דראש השנה (ט\"ז ע\"ב) בהדיא דאליבא דכולי עלמא ברוב עבירות ליום הדין נדון בגיהנם, והתם איירי לעולם הבא דהא קאמר צדיקים גמורים נכתבים לחיי עולם הבא וכו' ואיך יסתור גמרא ערוך.</strong> ואם יאמר דהא דאמרינן שאפילו במצוה אחת זוכה לעולם הבא היינו שעושה מצוה אחת אבל לא עשה שום עבירה אם כן אין כאן להגדיל שכר כלל, דסוף סוף כאשר יש להם הרבה מצות אפשר שיעשה הרבה חטאים ויהיו החטאים מכריעים. ואם רצה הרמב\"ם ז\"ל כאשר עושה מצוה ולא עשה שום חטא כנגד זה, בודאי כדבריו כן הוא. ודבר זה משנה פשוטה בפרק קמא דקידושין (ל\"ט ע\"ב) כל העושה מצוה אחת מטיבין לו ומאריכין לו ימיו ונוחל הארץ, ואף על גב דמוקי ליה שם כשעשה מצוה אחת יתירה על מחצה עונות, כל שכן שיש ללמוד מזה שאם עשה מצוה אחת ולא עשה שום חטא שזוכה לעולם הבא, אך אם כן אין צריך לדבר זה מה שכתב שעשה מצוה אחת ולא שתף עמה כונה אחרת סוף סוף למדנו כי אין הדבר כמו שפירש הרמב\"ם ז\"ל דבמצוה אחת זוכה לחיי עולם הבא.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The only answer that seems reasonable to me is to say the Rambam meant 1. to be an additional requirement <em>over and above</em> 2. and 3. Otherwise, it is a contradiction.\nWhen the Rambam says \"כמו שביארתי לך\", he could just be referring to somewhere he explains the concept of doing a mitzvah מאהבה -from love, and not the entire <em>chiddush</em> stated here. This would avoid the problem in Rabbi Qafih's approach.</p>\n<p>As to why the Rambam came up with this <em>chiddush</em>, I would suggest that he was bothered by the same question the Maharal asks on that Mishnah:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>ומעתה יש לשאול כי איך יאמר שה' חפץ לזכות את ישראל לכך הרבה להם מצות, ודבר זה נגד השכל שהיה לו למעט במצות כדי שלא יהיה צריך לשמור הרבה מצות, ואז היה זוכה לעולם הבא על ידי מיעוט מצות ממה שהוא מוסיף להם מצות שאז אי אפשר לזכות כל כך לעולם הבא\n[In short: The more mitzvos, the harder it is to fulfill them, so the harder it is to get to Olam Haba?]</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The Rambam answers that there is a(n additional -N.T.) requirement to fulfill one mitzvah properly, otherwise you don't get in.</p>\n\n\n",

Rather, he should be easily pacified, but hard to anger. When the person who wronged him asks for forgiveness, he should forgive him with a complete heart and a willing spirit. Even if he aggravated and wronged him severely, he should not seek revenge or bear a grudge.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>As you can see, the focus here is on actions, which others can see, more than on intentions, which are known only to the individual and to God.  When somebody comes to you to ask forgiveness, how do you know if he's sincere?  You don't.  But you know whether he has made amends (like paying for property he damaged), and you know that he has asked, in front of others, up to three times.  And even if he didn't, you should grant the request for forgiveness.</p>\n<p>So what about when the person doesn't ask for forgiveness?  You're allowed to forgive anyway, and in fact the Yom Kippur liturgy includes a sort of \"mutual forgiveness clause\" to cover both people who knowingly wronged you and didn't ask <em>and</em> those who didn't even know (so how could they ask?).  Naturally, you may only give forgiveness that is yours to give -- you can forgive people who wronged you, but it's not your place to forgive people who wronged others.  If the wronged party has died, then the matter is now between the transgressor and God.</p>\n\n\n",

(See קכ\"ג סק\"ח)</p>\n\n<p>The Shulchon Oruch goes with the opinion that at the end of the Amido you take three steps back and you're done. That is, l'Halocho you do not need to take three steps forward. (See id.)</p>\n\n<p>There is an opinion, not מעיקר הדין, that says no, part of the Amido is to take another three steps forward after you take three steps back. This is standard practice in many places though not necessarily as a matter of principle. According to this opinion, walking in front of someone who has not yet taken three steps forward is forbidden just like walking in front of someone who is in middle of the Amido, because this person who has not yet taken three steps forward <em>still is</em> in middle of the Amido. This is what the practice of not passing in front of someone who has not yet taken three steps forward is likely based on. (See id.)</p>\n\n<p>All this is just an inference from something the Mishno Bruro says, because the Mishno Bruro is not actually talking about a practice to refrain from passing in front of people at that point in the Amido, but rather a practice of people standing in their place at that point in the Amido preventing others from passing in front of them. The Mishno Bruro understands their protest as based on this explanation. The Mishno Bruro does not specifically discuss whether refraining on one's own is a worthy practice, and one might argue that this is because he assumes the עיקר הדין governs in this context. One thing is for sure though, if a person is not protesting it is certainly not forbidden to pass in front according to the letter of the Halocho.</p>\n\n\n",

Those are not curses!</p>\n\n<p>In the case of Yosef/Brothers/Binyamin:<br>\n - The wording used indicates death from a judgement (See \"Targum Yonasan\" who translates this as יהי חייב קטול, or will be worthy of a death sentence)<br>\n - This must be a judgment, as all of the major Mefarshim that discuss this say that they are allowing themselves to be killed by Yosef in response to their actions (see <a href=\"http://mg.alhatorah.org/Full/Bereshit/44/9#e0n7\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">http://mg.alhatorah.org/Full/Bereshit/44/9#e0n7</a>)</p>\n\n<p>A lot of other factors will have influenced the above, such as context and specific wording.</p>\n\n<p>Some other answers would include that Rachel was actually guilty of taking the idols, whereas Binyamin was innocent, or that when Yosef's housekeeper suggested that Binyamin be taken as a slave instead, that \"replaced\" the mention of the death sentence.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>However, afterwards, when the goblet had been discovered in the travel bag of Binyamin, they no longer mentioned the death penalty but offered themselves collectively as slaves to Joseph [Tur HaAroch, Genesis 44:9 - I believe this is in reference to Genesis 44:16]</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Tur_HaAroch%2C_Genesis.44.9?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://www.sefaria.org/Tur_HaAroch%2C_Genesis.44.9?lang=bi</a></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>ויאמר יהודה מה־נאמר לאדני מה־נדבר ומה־נצטדק האלהים מצא את־עון עבדיך <strong>הננו עבדים</strong> <strong>לאדני גם־אנחנו גם אשר־נמצא הגביע בידו</strong><br>Judah replied, “What can we say to my lord?

They advanced, constantly attacking the Moabites,\n  and they destroyed the towns. Every man threw a stone into each fertile field, so that it was covered over; and they stopped up every spring and <strong>felled every fruit tree</strong>. Only the walls of Kir-hareseth were left, and then the slingers surrounded it and attacked it.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>However this violates Devarim 20:19</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>When in your war against a city you have to besiege it a long time in order to capture it, you must not destroy its trees, wielding the ax against them. You may eat of them, but you must not cut them down. Are trees of the field human to withdraw before you into the besieged city?</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Presumably the reason they did this is because the Navi told them to in pasuk 19</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>You shall conquer every fortified town and every splendid city; <strong>you shall fell every good tree</strong> and stop up all wells of water; and every fertile field you shall ruin with stones. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I would like to understand why this was commanded.

On page 165, he describes how Yishma'el is the corruption, or waste material, of his father's chesed (he cites Medrash Sifri Vezos Haberacha as support).</p>\n\n<p>He describes that Yishma'el's chesed was chesed which was flipped to chesed of impurity, namely illicit relationships. This happens when chesed is unbridled and has no limitations set on it, no curtailing through a counterbalance of gevurah. We see this idea from the Torah's description of illicit relations as \"חסד הוא\" - reproduction is in and of itself a great chesed, as one is enabling existence itself to the following generation. However, when it has no limitations and leaves the context in which it is meant to be performed, it reduces to plain and simple lust at best, and to sin after that.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>Chabad of the West Side discusses this concept in <a href=\"http://www.chabadwestside.org/templates/articlecco_cdo/aid/3176849/jewish/Vayechi.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Parshas Vayechi</a></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Chassidic thought explains that Abraham was the personification of the\n  Divine attribute of chesed-kindness and love. Isaac, on the other\n  hand, was the embodiment of the trait of gevurah-strength, which\n  incorporates awe, judgment and discipline. These traits manifested\n  themselves in the way Abraham and Isaac served G‑d and the way they\n  dealt with others. Abraham served G‑d with love; Isaac with awe;\n  Abraham spread his light outward; Isaac turned inward and\n  introspective. Abraham showered hospitality and love; Isaac demanded\n  high standards.</p>\n  \n  <p>Chesed and love, Abraham’s attributes, and likewise Isaac’s attribute\n  of gevurah, while positive and holy when they were manifested through\n  Abraham and Isaac, can actually be the source of negativity as they\n  emerge from their source.</p>\n  \n  <p>To cite a few examples:</p>\n  \n  <p>Exaggerated kindness to a child or student can often lead to an\n  atmosphere of permissiveness. Giving alcohol to an alcoholic who\n  pleads for it may outwardly come through as an act of kindness but it\n  is just as negative an act as assaulting that person.</p>\n  \n  <p>The emotion of love, which motivates acts of kindness, can also lead\n  to immoral behavior.</p>\n  \n  <p>Indeed, the Talmud states that incest is referred to in the Torah as\n  chesed. This is explained in the Talmud by referring to Cain and\n  Abel’s incestuous marriage to their twin sisters through which they\n  populated the world; an act ultimately forbidden and regarded as\n  deeply immoral and a heinous crime. Hence, the Talmud says, we can\n  understand what the Psalmist means when he stated “The world was\n  created with chesed!”</p>\n  \n  <p>Chesed is, therefore, necessarily situational. There are times when it\n  is considered to be the most exalted and cherished aspects of human\n  personality and at other times it can mark the nadir of depravity.</p>\n  \n  <p>Thus, our Sages underscore that Yishmael departed from Abraham and\n  Esau departed from Isaac. Yishmael personified the chesed and love of\n  Abraham but in its degenerate form and Esau was an extension of\n  Isaac’s gevurah as he sank into violence. While they inherited their\n  fathers’ characteristics of chesed and gevurah, respectively, they\n  channeled them into the realm of evil.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Execution by Bet Din\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>Learning gemara I did not see any death sentences that were carried out by the Bet Din.\nDid the Bet Din ever carry out a death penalty case?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>The last Mishnah in the first chapter of Makkos states:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>A SANHEDRIN THAT EFFECTS AN EXECUTION ONCE IN SEVEN YEARS, IS BRANDED\n  A DESTRUCTIVE TRIBUNAL; R. ELIEZER B. AZARIAH SAYS: ONCE IN SEVENTY\n  YEARS. R. TARFON AND R. AKIBA SAY: WERE WE MEMBERS OF A SANHEDRIN, NO\n  PERSON WOULD EVER BE PUT TO DEATH. [THEREUPON] RABBAN SIMEON B.\n  GAMALIEL REMARKED, [YEA] AND THEY WOULD ALSO MULTIPLY SHEDDERS OF\n  BLOOD IN ISRAEL!\n  (Soncino translation)</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The Gemara (7a) adds:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>A SANHEDRIN THAT EFFECTS AN EXECUTION ONCE IN SEVEN YEARS IS BRANDED A\n  DESTRUCTIVE TRIBUNAL; R. ELIEZER B. AZARIAH SAYS, ONCE IN SEVENTY\n  YEARS. The question was raised whether the comment [of R. Eliezer b.\n  Azariah was a censure, namely] that even one death-sentence in seventy\n  years branded the Sanhedrin as a destructive tribunal, or [a mere\n  observation] that it ordinarily happened but once in seventy years? —\n  It stands [undecided].\n  (Soncino translation)</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The implication is that executions did happen, but very rarely. </p>\n\n<p>In fact, just a couple of pages earlier (5b) the Gemara records a case of a false witness being put to death:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>It has been taught: R. Judah b. Tabbai said: ‘May I [never] see\n  consolation [of Israel] if I did not have one zomemim-witness done to\n  death to disabuse the mind of the Sadducees, who used to say that\n  zomemim [found guilty] were put to death only after the [falsely]\n  accused person had [actually] been executed.’ Said Simeon b. Shetah to\n  him: ‘May I [never] see consolation [of Israel] if you have not shed\n  innocent blood because the Sages declared that witnesses found to be\n  zomemim are not put to death until both have been proved as such, and\n  are not [juridically] flogged until both have been proved as such.’\n  Forthwith did Judah b. Tabbai take upon himself a resolve never to\n  deliver a decision save in the presence of Simeon b. Shetah.29   And\n  all through his [remaining] days, Judah b. Tabbai used to go and\n  prostrate himself on the grave of that [slain] witness, and his voice\n  would be heard and people thought that it was the voice of the slain\n  man; but he would tell them, ‘It is my voice! You will be convinced\n  when on the morrow of this man's [his own] death his voice will be\n  heard no more’.\n  (Soncino translation)</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Another example of execution occurs in Sanhedrin 52b. </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Imarta the daughter of Tali, a priest, committed adultery. Thereupon\n  R. Hama b. Tobiah had her surrounded by faggots and burnt. R. Joseph2 \n  said: He [R. Hama] was ignorant of two laws. He was ignorant of R.\n  Mathna's dictum3   and of the following Baraitha: And thou shalt come\n  unto the priests, the Levites, and unto the judge that shall be in\n  those days:4   This teaches that when the priesthood is functioning\n  [in the Temple], the judge functions [in respect of capital\n  punishment]; but when the priesthood is not functioning, the judge may\n  not function.5  (Soncino translation)</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>However, in this case R. Solomon Luria suggests that it was an extra-judicial execution. </p>\n\n<p>Also, the court of Moses executed the wood-gatherer (Numbers 15:32-36) and the blasphemer (Leviticus 24:10-23). </p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>Yes. There are cases recorded in the gemara of Bet Din carrying out executions. Here is one example from <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Sanhedrin.45b?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Sanhedrin 45b</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Rabbi Eliezer said to the Rabbis: Did Shimon ben Shataḥ not hang in Ashkelon women who were found guilty of witchcraft?</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>(I am aware that the <em>mishna</em> goes on to point out that this may have been carried out in extraordinary circumstances, rather than following the strict protocols usually employed, but it is still an example of execution by Bet Din.)</p>\n\n\n",

There is a problem with rubbing off the mud on the dirt ground, lest your shoe mud fill in a depression in the dirt. If you have leather soles, there is a problem with scraping your shoes against a sharp (or, according to the <em>Magen Avraham</em>, even dull) metal edge, due to the prohibition of smoothing leather (<em>m'macheik</em>). A minority opinion prohibits wiping the mud on a stone wall, as it could seem like adding mortar to the stones for construction purposes (a wooden wall, for example, would pose no halachic problem). </p>\n\n<p>According to the <em>Mishna B'rura</em>, one may readily follow the lenient opinion permitting wiping off wet mud from a leather sole on a dull or smooth metal threshold, provided one rubs off the mud gently. The <em>Bei'ur Halacha</em> adds that it is preferable to be stringent in this regard with dry mud (since a person would be more prone to scrape his leather sole more vigorously to get the mud off), although he cites the <em>P'ri M'gadim</em> that one may also be lenient with dry mud if the mud causes him distress.</p>\n\n<p>There is another reason to potentially be more strict about dry mud than wet mud, regardless of whether one's soles are made of leather or rubber. According to Rabbeinu Peretz, causing the dry mud to flake off into small pieces or into powder would be a problem of <a href=\"https://www.ou.org/holidays/shabbat/melacha-8-tochein-grinding/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><em>tochein</em></a>. Nevertheless, as mentioned above, the <em>P'ri M'gadim</em> says one may be lenient if the mud causes him distress.</p>\n\n<p>If part of the shoe is made of fabric, it would also probably be prohibited to rub the fabric to remove mud stains in order to make the fabric look clean (see <em>Mishna B'rura</em> 302:36, see also the beginning of <em>siman</em> 302). However, merely scraping tangible wet mud off the fabric is permissible. (The earlier proviso about grinding dry mud and <em>tochein</em> would also apply here).</p>\n\n\n",

I was further told that miracle claims by non-Jews were simply false. For example Jesus simply did not <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marriage_at_Cana\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">turn water into wine</a>. </p>\n\n<p>Theologically, how does Judaism view claims from other religions that God or a person has performed a miracle on their behalf? Does Judaism allow for the belief that God does miracles for non-Jews? </p>\n\n<p>Please note: I am not asking about miracles performed by Non-Jews through the use of magic, divination or other forbidden practices (eg. Bilaam, the witch of En-Dor) that involve manipulation of natural or spiritual forces. </p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>Your question implies belief in magical forces that apparently aren't a proof of some other religion, or set of beliefs.  If, indeed, one subscribes to such beliefs, then any story of miracles ought not present a problem, as even if true, they could be the result of such magic.[i]</p>\n\n<p>Significantly, Rambam writes emphatically (Hilkhot Yesodei HaTorah 8:1) that belief in Judaism is not based on miracles, (but on the Sinaic revelation which the entire nation experienced), for miracles can be dismissed as magic or the like.</p>\n\n<p>Accordingly, miracles occurring to members of other religions shouldn't pose a theological problem.</p>\n\n<p>Indeed, the Torah itself (Deut. 13:2-6) describes a false prophet who promotes <em>avoda zara</em>, and performs miracles. Although this is probably referring to a Jewish \"prophet\", the message seems to be clear; miracles are not proof of legitimacy.</p>\n\n<p>Regarding whether the miracles could be miracles, or must assumed to be fake, Midrash Tannaim (Deut. 13:3) records a dispute between R. Yossi the Galilean, and R. Akiva. R. Yossi suggests that the aforementioned false prophet could do an actual miracle, like stopping the sun. R. Akiva, however, considers it inconceivable that God would perform a miracle for a sinner. (Therefore R. Akiva suggests that the verse refers to a lapsed prophet who previously performed miracles when he was righteous). </p>\n\n<p>It seems that according to R. Akiva, miracles performed by sinners (which doesn't necessarily include non-Jews) should be assumed to not be real, while according to R. Yossi, it could be an actual miracle.</p>\n\n<p>However, even in light of R. Yossi's view, demonstrable miracles are few and far in between (cf. <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One_Million_Dollar_Paranormal_Challenge\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">James Randi's million dollar challenge</a>), so it is probably safe to assume that no miracle has taken place absent compelling proof to the contrary.</p>\n\n<p>This Tannatic dispute also appears in Sifrei (Re'eh 84) and Sanhedrin (90a).</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>[i] Not that the existence of magic necessarily has to be accepted at all. See <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/a/67771/8775\">here</a> regarding different approaches to the witch of En-Dor, and magic in general.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>Did God perform a miracle for so-and-so (Gentile)? Perhaps. Why not? It happens throughout Tanach, why not post-Tanach?

I  do not understand therefore  if in this case there has been a real divorce.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 5)\n\n<p>The Maggid Mishne (Rav Vidal of Tolosa, spain 14th century) on the Rambam Hilchot Ishut 1,1 says that before <em>Mattan Torah</em> (giving the Torah to Israel) everyone had a status of a gentile and he cross-references to Hilchot Melachim  9 for all the rules of marriage:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>קודם מתן תורה היה אדם פוגע אשה בשוק אם רצה הוא והיא לישא אותה מכניסה לתוך בית - ובועלה בינו לבין עצמו ותהיה לו לאשה וזה פשוט ומבואר בהרבה מקומות דלנכרי בייחוד בעלמא הויא אשתו וכנזכר פרק ט' מהלכות מלכים      </p>\n  \n  <p>Before the Torah was given, a man met a woman, she would enter his domain with consent as a designated wife, consummate privately and they would be married since a Gentile (Jews were also considered gentiles) suffices to get married with designation as stated Rambam chapter 9 of Hilchos Melachim.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>In Rambam Hilchot Melachim 9,8:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>וּמֵאֵימָתַי תִּהְיֶה אֵשֶׁת חֲבֵרוֹ כִּגְרוּשָׁה שֶׁלָּנוּ מִשֶּׁיּוֹצִיאֶנָּה מִבֵּיתוֹ וִישַׁלְּחֶנָּה לְעַצְמָהּ. אוֹ מִשֶּׁתֵּצֵא הִיא מִתַּחַת רְשׁוּתוֹ וַתֵּלֶךְ לָהּ. שֶׁאֵין לָהֶם גֵּרוּשִׁין בִּכְתָב. וְאֵין הַדָּבָר תָּלוּיִ בּוֹ לְבַד. אֶלָּא כָּל זְמַן שֶׁיִּרְצֶה הוּא אוֹ הִיא לִפְרשׁ זֶה מִזֶּה פּוֹרְשִׁין</p>\n  \n  <p>When would a married woman be  (i.e gentile) be considered divorced? When her husband expels her from his house or if she leaves herself, for there is no written divorce, and it's not up to him alone, but whenever he or she wants to leave each other, they are divorced.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Abraham our Patriach before <em>Mattan Torah</em> was Married to Sarah through consummation in his domain(Genesis 20,3) in the Same manner as Gentiles as stated in Yerushalmi Kiddushin 1,1:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>בנכרים רבי אבהו בשם ר' אלעזר כתיב (בראשית כ׳:ג׳) הנך מת על האשה אשר לקחת והיא בעולת בעל על הבעולות הן חייבין ואינן חייבין על הארוסות מילתיה דרבי אלעזר אמרה והוא שנתכוון לקנותה</p>\n  \n  <p>What is marriage for gentiles? Rabbi Elaazar said Its written regarding Avimelech King of the Philistines (Bereshis 20,3): \"You will die because of the woman (Sarah) you have seized, yet she is consummated to a Husband (i.e Abraham)\" -on consummated wives one is liable to death but not for betrothed wives, and even regarding consummated wives one needs intent on marriage (i.e not prostitution).</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

The Israelites were unified and could have served as a focus of resistance since the Egyptians still remembered how Yosef had saved them. Thus, the <em>new king</em> carefully built up resentment against them and began forcing them into the position of <em>enemy of society</em> and the lowest of the low (as slaves) so that there would be someone for all the other groups to look down upon.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Note in general: (a) this first anti-semitism was not brought about by\n  anything the Jews had done.

Perhaps most famously, Rambam (in his introduction to Commentary on Mishnayos) explained the position of each tractate based on specific reasons, such as order of scriptual verses, topic progression, halachic status, etc. However, there is an astonishing correlation between the sequence of tractates and number of chapters per tractate. In orders Moed, Nashim, Nezikin*, Kodshim and Taharos there is a perfect descending sequence based on chapter numbers.

Reuven Margoliot</a> in his work Yesod Hamishnah V'arichata (<a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=32665&st=&pgnum=24\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">p. 26</a>) does in fact explain the sequence of tractates based on size by number of chapters.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>אולם המתבונן ימצא בכל סדר משנה סדר מלאכותי כי מה דאפשי מפרש ברישא\n  [נדרים כ' ע\"א]\n   שהקדים רבי בכל סדר המסכתות הכוללות פרקים יותר לפני\n  המסכתות הקטנות </p>\n  \n  <p>However, one who contemplates will find in each mishnaic order a\n  practical order, that that which is larger is explained first [Nedarim\n  20a], for in each order Rebbe placed the tractates with more chapters\n  before the small tractates.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>He goes on to speak about this at length and shows how this is the case in each order. However, this is still a pretty recent source as Rabbinic Literature goes (published within the last 100 years) and he does not attribute the idea to any earlier source, nor does he discuss why no earlier sources mentioned this.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: -2)\n\n<p>It might be because some of the chapters in a tractate aren't directly connected to its main topic. Take Yevamos, for example: it has 16 chapters, which is more than any other one in Seder Nashim, but most of chapters 6-8 and 15-16 could easily have been placed in some other masechta (and if Yevamos weren't first in its Seder, they might have been).</p>\n\n<p>edit: All right, apparently for the sake of those who have many thoughts and those who are searching, let me flesh out the answer.</p>\n\n<p>The questions were, \"Did the rishonim/acharonim simply not pick up on this pattern? Did they realize it but didn't care, preferring to give Torah-based explanations? Did they consider the couple of exceptions as refutations to the theory?\"</p>\n\n<p>And I say: what pattern? It doesn't exist in Zeraim. It doesn't necessarily exist in Nashim (because if Yevamos weren't first, some of its 16 chapters would probably have been placed in other masechtos). Already that cuts out 33% of the \"pattern.\" Add other cases within the middle of a Seder, such as the 10th chapter of Eruvin (which ends up with the same number of chapters as Pesachim and therefore can go before it - but if that 10th chapter had been in Shabbos, where it better belongs, then Eruvin would have only 9), chapters 5-8 of Shekalim (same thing relative to Yoma), and the first 3 chapters of Shevuos (same thing relative to Eduyos), and the \"pattern\" largely falls apart. Much better to look for answers based on the main topics of the masechtos, which is what the Rishonim did.</p>\n\n<p>And yet another edit:</p>\n\n<p>Is the Number of Chapters Per Tractate Relevant?</p>\n\n<p>No.</p>\n\n<p>Did the rishonim/acharonim simply not pick up on this pattern?</p>\n\n<p>No, because there is no such pattern.</p>\n\n<p>Did they realize it but didn't care, preferring to give Torah-based explanations?</p>\n\n<p>Yes, they must surely have realized that sometimes longer masechtos (in terms of content related directly to the topic) are before shorter ones. They didn't care, because there are at least as many exceptions as confirmations.</p>\n\n<p>Did they consider the couple of exceptions as refutations to the theory?</p>\n\n<p>Most likely yes. But unless we go back in time to ask them (or wait for techias hameisim), we won't know for sure.</p>\n\n\n",

And when the inhabitants of the land, the Canaanites, saw the mourning in the floor of Atad, they said: 'This is a grievous mourning to the Egyptians.' Wherefore the name of it was called Abel-mizraim, which is beyond the Jordan. (JPS translation)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Why would Yaakov's funeral procession be in Ever HaYarden (normally translated as Transjordan i.e. the eastern bank of the Jordan) if they were travelling from Egypt to bury him in Hebron? If they were following the most direct route, they would never be east of the Jordan?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 8)\n\n<p>Another two approaches by mainstream Peshat Mefarshim:</p>\n<p>Shadal here (and Clint Eastwood in the comments above) suggests that for Moshe and Benei Yisrael, Ever Hayarden is Eretz Yisroel, because they had not entered Eretz Yisroel.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>אשר בעבר הירדן – בא״י, ונקרא בעבר הירדן כלפי המקום שהיו בו משה וישראל.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Haamek_Davar_on_Genesis.50.10.1\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Netziv</a> here disagrees with the premise of Joel K's question, and says that from the fact that they reached Transjordan <strong>it shows that they did not take the most direct route</strong>, rather, they tried to pass through other lands and areas so more people would join the funeral precession.  He compares this to Mishna Keilim 1:7 which describes a similar phenomenon.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>ויבואו עד גורן האטד אשר בעבר הירדן – באמת ההולך ממצרים מערבה דרומה של ארץ ישראל לחברון מזרחה, אין צריך להגיע לירדן כלל, אלא בהגיעו נגד חברון מעקם דרכו לצפון ובא לחברון. אבל יוסף הקיף מהלכו הלאה כדי שיתוספו במהלכו הרבה ממואב וכנענים היושבים על יד הירדן. ומזה שנינו במסכת כלים (פ״א מ״ז) ׳ומסבבים לתוכן מת עד שירצו׳, הרי דדרך לסבב בנשיאה ממקום למקום עד שמגיע למקום קבורה, והוא לכבודו של מת.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Netziv is an extremely valuable interpretation because according to him, Ever Hayarden <strong>IS</strong> Transjordan, thus making it a possible explanation according to Targumim (and commentaries) who appear to say that Ever Hayarden means Transjordan by translating it the same way as Ever Hayarden everywhere else.</p>\n<p>Edit: See also Shu\"t Terumas Hagoren (the irony!) 2:58, who also understands that Ever Hayarden means Transjordan, and provides another reason (later also suggested by DonielF):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>לפי שיטה זו של התנחומא ורש\"י יש לומר שגם המסלול לשאת את ארונו של יעקב\nלמערת המכפלה נקבע להם ע\"י יעקב בהתאם למסלול יציאתם של בני ישראל ממצרים\nוכניסתם לארץ. כי העלאת ארונו של יעקב לארץ היתה מעין חזרה לקראת יציאת\nבני ישראל ממצרים וכניסתם לארץ. וכשם שקבע להם יעקב את סדר המסע והחניה,\nכך קבע להם את המסלול של הדרך, שחייב להיות זהה עם המסלול של יציאת בני\nישראל ממצרים.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Edit #2: JoelK, in the comments thread, suggested the possibility that they did not want to pass through Pelishti lands because they were afraid of an attack by the Pelishtim, and they therefore travelled through the Transjordan.  While I was originally skeptical of this approach, it is found in the Rashi Kepshuto/Peshuto Shel Mikrah Chumash (Leshem Publications) in the Peshat commentary. It is also suggested by Rabbi Zalman Sorotzkin in Oznaim Latorah (he also offers the view of Maaseh Avos Siman Labanim, as above).</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 7)\n\n<p>All the answers that I've come across suggest that <strong>Ever HaYarden does not mean Transjordan in the context of this verse.</strong></p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p><a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=39852&st=&pgnum=58\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Chizkuni</a> suggests that that the Canaanites who are observing the mourning at the threshing-floor of Atad were those who lived under Sichon and Og on the eastern bank of the Jordan.

(See Sefer HaHinnukh 294, 244, 452).</p>\n\n<p>R. Sh'lomo Ibn Gabirol writes in the introduction of his Tikkun Middot HaNefesh that akhzariut (cruelty or callousness) is the worst character trait. And Jewish literature is replete with references to the evils of callousness and the greatness of kindness and caring. For just one example, note Rabbenu Yonah in Sha'arei Teshuva (3:36) who writes that the point of Deuteronomy (15:7) which enjoins us to help the poor and not \"harden our hearts\", is that besides for just helping the poor, the act should specifically come from compassion.</p>\n\n<p>Similarly, the opinion of some that <em>mitsvot tsrikhot kavana</em>; fulfillment of the mitsvot depends on intent, likely doesn't apply to interpersonal mitsvot. For example, R. Ya'akov Ariel (cited <a href=\"http://asif.co.il/sourcesheets/35607-2/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a>) writes:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>אלא על כרחך במצוות שבין אדם לחבירו ניתן לצאת ידי חובה גם בלא כוונה. וזאת משום שעיקר מטרתן היא לא עצם המעשה אלא התוצאות שיש מהן לזולת</p>\n  \n  <p>Rather it is clear that it is possible to fulfill interpersonal mitsvot without intent. And this is because [unlike ritual mitsvot] their main purpose is not the act itself, but the result of that act to others.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Similarly, the Seridei Esh (I:61 cited there) writes that in the case of charity, giving out of compassion or love is superior to giving due to a technical obligation:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>וכן הדין בצדקה, שאם הוא נותן מתוך רחמנות או מתוך אהבת ישראל טוב יותר ממי שנותן מתוך צווי וכפיה</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>It seems obvious that this was R. Tatz's point; that one should not be so callous as to ignore a person's plight, and only be moved to activity by some technical mitsva. Rather, one should be motivated by care and compassion.</p>\n\n<p>See the above link for other sources for this idea from Rambam and others.</p>\n\n\n",

Tosafot write that the buyers have the right to\n  examine the body since they stand to lose money. Financial loss is a\n  permissible reason to examine the body, according to Tosafot.\n  <strong>However, suggest Tosafot, the family has a special obligation to the deceased and thus even for financial loss cannot degrade the body.</strong>\n  Therefore, Rabbi Akiva had to bring the second answer that even for\n  the buyers who are permitted to defile the body because of financial\n  loss, examining the body would not help because signs of puberty\n  change after death. According to Tosafot, the prohibition of nivul\n  hamet applies only when there is no good reason to defile the\n  deceased; but for an acceptable purpose, such as monetary loss, nivul\n  hamet would not apply.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Although you are correct that a doctor son can treat his father if he is the only one (or the best one) to do so (MT <a href=\"http://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/1181856/jewish/Mamrim-Chapter-5.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Hilkhot Mamrim 5:7</a> or <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/q/38435/11501\">here</a> on MY), in the context of an autopsy it is difficult to imagine one couldn't bring a second specialist since there is less urgency.</p>\n\n\n",

Here are a few citations from within the work that seem to indicate that his purpose in writing the work and listing the \"shorshei hamitzvos\" was mainly to convince the youth of the benefits of doing mitzvos.</p>\n\n<p>Mitzvah 117</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>שרשי מצוה זו נעלמים מאד למצוא אפילו רמז קטן מהן ואולם מפני שכבר הודעתי\n  בפתח דברי שכוונתי באלו הטעמים שאני כותב להרגיל הנערים ולהטעים להם\n  בתחילת בואם לשמוע דברי ספר כי יש לדברי התורה טעמים ותועלות ויקבלום על\n  דרך ההרגל שלהם וכפי חולשת שכלם ואל יהיו להם המצוות בתחילה כדברי הספר\n  החתום פן יבעטו בהם מתוך כך בנערותם ויניחום לעולם וילכו בהבל על כן\n  אכתוב בהם כל אשר יעלה בתחילת המחשבה ואל יתפוש עלי תופש בשום דבר אחרי\n  ידע הכוונה</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Epilogue to Sefer Vayikra</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>והנני עודני בא להזכירך במה שהתנצלתי הרבה פעמים על השרשים אשר מלאני לני\n  לכתוב נמצות שאין הכונה רק לחנך הנערים ולתת אל לבם כי יש במצות תועלות\n  רבות גלויות לכל אדם כאשר יוכלון הבין בילדותם ועל כן קראתי שם הספר\n  חינוך ועומק חכמתם ורוב תועלתם אם יזכו ישיגו בם בימי זקנתם הלא ידעת כי\n  יש פרי נמצא אשר בו כמה תרופות בסגולה וגם טוב לאכלה ואיש חכם יודע לבפר\n  בשבחי תרופותיו ואשר לא ידע בכל אלה יאמר שהוא טוב לאוכליו</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Mitzvah 440</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>וזה נאמר אל הילדים עד אשר יגדלו בחכמה ויבינו בכל דברי התורה סודות\n  נפלאים</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Mitzvah 545</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>והנה הארכתי לכתוב לך בני כל זה להעיד על כל שרשי ספרי עדים נאמנים שני\n  עמודי עולם חכמים גדולים ונבונים בעלי שכל מזוקק ובסתרי התורה מקובלים כי\n  הנך רואה בעיניך דעת שניהם כי יש במצוות התורה טעם להועיל בני אדם\n  בדעותיהם להכשירם ולהרגילם להכשיר בהן כל פעולותיהם ושאין התועלת בעשייתן\n  חלילה לבורא ברוך הוא ואם אמנם כי יש מן המצוות שלא השגנו בטעמן במיעוט\n  שכלנו מרוב עומקן ותכלית גודלן לא נמנע ממנו מהגיד בהן כל אשר נשיג למצוא\n  מן התועלת שיש לו לאדם בעשייתן וזה דרכי בכל שיחתי בספרי זה שיש במצוות\n  תועלת מצוי לנו אך לא אל המצוה בהן ואם תתן לבך בדברים תמצא זאת הכוונה\n  בכולן והרבה יגעתי במקצתן להשיג בעניות דעתי לראות בהן מעט קט מרוב\n  התועלות שבהן וכתבתיו על כל אחת וזה חלקי מכל עמל</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>To clarify, I am not saying that the Sefer Hachinuch simply doesn't believe his \"reasons\" to necessarily be the definitive reasons. Rambam would say the same thing about his own \"reasons\". Rather I am trying to contrast the Sefer Hachinuch with Rambam, to say that Rambam is giving reasons <strong>for</strong> the mitzvos while the Sefer Hachinuch is mainly giving benefits of the mitzvos (i.e. reasons <strong>to do</strong> mitzvos).</p>\n\n\n",

R. Elyashiv is quoted as rejecting this idea <a href=\"http://www.bhol.co.il/mobile/article.aspx?id=93000&cat=46&scat=298\" rel=\"noreferrer\">here</a>. Similarly, <a href=\"http://asif.co.il/?wpfb_dl=7531\" rel=\"noreferrer\">this article</a> quotes Yossef Omets (pg. 270) as referencing this superstition, but nevertheless encouraging the study of the laws. There is also a famous passage in Sefer Hassidim (291) encouraging the study of Moed Kattan and the third chapter of Berakhot. Presumably this was due to a superstition about studying death related material, but the Sefer Hassidim nevertheless extols such study. The article also infers from Igrot Moshe (YD Vol. IV:60:4) that there is no problem for non-mourners to study the material. R. Hayyim Kanievsky is similarly quoted (Shu\"t Hok Heshiv YD: 5) as stating not to be concerned with this superstition.</p>\n\n<p>The idea behind not learning the laws of Nidda is presumably that it is inappropriate / and or may arouse inappropriate thoughts.

As a result, Adam and Chava, who knew no bad at this point, were not embarrassed by the other person (or themselves) having bad thoughts.</p>\n\n<p>This indicates that Shadal holds the embarrassment was from themselves/each other, despite their being married, as they were at that point experiencing bad thoughts etc, as he suggests.</p>\n\n<p>This approach happens to fit in very well with the above-mentioned Halacha. Children who do not yet understand the possible \"bad thoughts\" would not be thinking them about others, and would not be worried about others thinking about them.

This feeling meant that they were afraid of being in the presence of Hashem.</p>\n\n<p>Rashi points out that it was not physical nakedness, but moral and spiritual, having disobeyed the one mitzvah that they had. Thus, even with the aprons  they still felt <em>naked</em> (see below from Rav Hirsch). In fact according to this, even if they had been completely covered, head to toe, they still would have felt <em>naked</em> when Hashem <em>came</em>.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.chabad.org/library/bible_cdo/aid/8167#v=7&showrashi=true\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rashi</a></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><strong>and they knew that they were naked</strong>: Even a blind man knows when he is naked!

Not because of his body being naked, but because he no\n  longer dared let his naked body be seen, was what made him afraid for\n  himself.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Thus, he would have been afraid no matter what he was wearing and no matter how covered up he might have been. It was not a matter of denying that he had eaten, but the consciousness of having disobeyed and feeling the results of that.</p>\n\n<p>Rav Hirsch in verse 7 says </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>But the consciousness of being naked is the consciousness that\n  something is visible that should not be so. This is the feeling of\n  shame, which as indicated above, has its roots in the consciousness of\n  a person of the real calling of Man. As long as Man stands completely\n  in the service of his Hashem, he is not to be ashamed of any part of\n  his body. Even the bodily lures and attractions are pure and godly as\n  long as they submit themselves as means for Hashem's holy purposes.\n  But when this condition is not entirely there we certainly should be\n  ashamed of displaying them. This shame awakes the voice within us,\n  which is intimately connected with the conscience, and reminds us that\n  we are not to be animals.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

After he proclaimed the specialty of each one of them, he\n  blessed him accordingly, that in his specialty and by and with that\n  specialty he should find blessing i.e. happiness and satisfaction.</p>\n  \n  <p>...</p>\n  \n  <p>that is why it says, each one according to his blessing, he blessed\n  <strong>them</strong>, not him אותו, but all of them אותם \"each one participated in a general blessing, and the special blessing of each one was for the\n  benefit of all.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Here he has described the mission of each son and what he will contribute to the whole.</p>\n\n<p>Rav Hirsch also makes clear that <a href=\"http://www.chabad.org/library/bible_cdo/aid/8222#v=29&showrashi=true\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Toldos 27:29</a> that the blessing will apply <strong>only</strong> if Eisav fulfills the mission by translating the end of that verse as</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>People will serve the and natons bow down to thee - Be a Man to thy\n  brethren so that thy mother's sons bow down to the, <strong>Then</strong> whoso\n  curseth thee will be cursed and whoso blesseth thee will be blessed.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Rav Hirsch explains this way of taking the pasuk as:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>By the material prosperity which Hashem will grant you, nations and\n  states will bow down before you, but seek to compete with your brother\n  Jacob to obtain the spiritual greatness also, so that not only\n  strangers but the sons of your mother bow down before you that you\n  stand before them as a \"man\", <em>then</em> if you achieve this, <em>then</em>\n  אורריך אאור ומברכיך ברוך.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>In this case, Yitzchak was setting out the mission of the son who would be dealing with the outside world and fighting off the yetzer Hara. That is why the blessing is framed in physical terms that only applied <strong>after</strong> the Israelites conquered Canaan. Until then they were shepherds as shown by the gifts Yaakov sent to Eisav.</p>\n\n<p>Rav Hirsch then explains <a href=\"http://www.chabad.org/library/bible_cdo/aid/8222#v=33&showrashi=true\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Toldos 27:33</a> </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>גַּם־בָּר֖וּךְ יִֽהְיֶֽה</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>similar to Rashi.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><strong>He, too, shall be blessed</strong>: That you should not say that had Jacob not deceived his father, he would not have received the blessings.\n  Therefore, he concurred and blessed him intentionally (Gen. Rabbah\n  67:2).</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>As Rav Hirsch says:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>For now it had become clear to him, how everyone in the Abrahamitic\n  nation, everything and everybody, soldiers, merchants etc. too, have\n  to be filled with the Abrahamitic spirit. So that he no longer saw any\n  position in the House of Abraham for Esau.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Since Rav Hirsch says that it was connected to the mission, Yaakov had to take on the mission to get the bracha.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p><strong>ADDENDUM</strong></p>\n\n<p>We see from the explanation of ארור in <a href=\"http://www.chabad.org/library/bible_cdo/aid/8173#v=25&showrashi=true\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Noach 9:25</a> as the opposite of ברוך that a similar principle apples.</p>\n\n\n",

Shouldn't he be avoiding him?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>The <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shem_Mishmuel\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Shem MiShmuel</a> (Parashat Vayetse) writes that Yaakov was originally meant to serve God through the mode of <em>assei tov</em>, and Esav was supposed to serve God through the mode of <em>sur mera</em>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>עקב ועשו ועל דעת כך נבראו. יעקב יזכה לשלימותו ע\"י עשה טוב, וכך הי' ממלא תעודתו איש תם יושב אוהלים. ועשו נברא עם תכונות רעות שהי' מושכין אותו לכל רע, והכוונה היתה שיתאמץ בכח על טבעו ויברח מן הרע ועי\"ז יבוא לעומתו למדריגות גדולות מאד </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Rivka realised that Esav wasn't fulfilling this mission, so she arranged for Yaakov to receive his blessing which transferred the mission serving God through <em>sur mera</em>. Accordingly, after the blessings, Ya'akov faced many hardships which challenged his behaviour, rather than his easier earlier life which allowed hom to more easily pursue good:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>ועשו הי' נמשך אחר תכונותיו הרעות עד שנעשה רשע גמור אדם בליעל. ורבקה הרגישה זה והשתדלה שגם בחי' סור מרע תמסר ליעקב ויזכה יעקב בשתיהן. וע\"כ עד אז הי' יעקב יושב בשלוה ולא היו לו שום מניעות ורדיפות שיצטרך להתאמץ עליהן ולברוח מהן, ומן אז והלאה התחיל אצלו פרק חדש שהיו לו כל ימיו מניעות ורדיפות רעות רבות וצרו (ibid).</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>The idea of splitting the job mission is fascinating on its own, and stresses the importance of different kinds of people comprising the Jewish Nation - each one fulfilling his aspect of a general mission.</p>\n\n<p>Mevaqesh already answered the question (kudos) and I would like to add a point to explain the framework of that differentiation:</p>\n\n<p>We learn that \"תלמוד תורה כנגד כולם\" (Peah 1), meaning that the effect of performing Mitzvot can be reached (presumably) just by properly studying them (I've found it in written... maybe in my chidduchim?)[1]. However on some very early point of the forefathers Abraham and Itzhok it became obvious that not all aspects can be achieved through extensive learning, and some physical deeds (aka Mitzvot) <strong>must</strong> be performed.</p>\n\n<p>And that was the original intention in differentiation the workload of Tikkun of the world between Yaakov and Eisov: Yaakov learning the Torah only his whole life, not marrying at all like Ben Azzay, and Eisov performing all the physical part of the Geulah - getting married, working, raising the 12 tribes etc.</p>\n\n<p>We can found some references to this, if you're familiar with some Drush terms: we know that Abraham was (associated with) Chessed and Itzhok with Gevuro (Din). As Eisov was also on the side of Din (\"Ra\" so to speak), Itzhok loved Eisov (and his way), which is called Sade (שדה - field), Eisov is called איש שדה and about Itzhok the TOrah says \"ויצא יצחק לשוח בשדה לפנות ערב\".</p>\n\n<p>The way of physical \"struggle\" is a shorter and faster way, but it is prone to following one's lust (like מצוות להנות ניתנו, one can receive enjoyment from a mitzvah and therefore forget the divine intentions). This is what practically happened to Eisov. Yaakov, on the other hand, could not fulfill Eisov's way of work by learning Torah alone, which lead him to switch to more \"physical\" behaviors, like going abroad, working, marrying, raising kids etc.</p>\n\n<p>[1] <em>This can explain the famous dispute about whether the forefathers kept the Mitzvot, according to this explanations there's no difference between physical performance of a Mitzva and studying it, so they performed all the Mitzvot just by studying Torah (בחי' \"ונשלמה פרים שפתנינו\".).</em></p>\n\n\n",

But looking at the original question points to the answer to your question.</p>\n\n<p>The <a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=9597&st=&pgnum=380\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Ohr HaChaim to Bereshit 29:18</a> comments on Yaacov offering to work 7 years for Rochel that a Tzaddik always subjugates <em>himself seven</em>. (עצמו שבע) This relates linguistically to the number <em>seven</em>, the verb <em>to satisfy</em>, and to <em>making an oath</em>. He says it relates to the Sod concept from Mishlei 24:16, שבע יפול צדיק וקם. That through subjugating for seven the adversary is satisfied and overturned by HaShem.</p>\n\n<p>This same idea is mentioned in <a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=9597&st=&pgnum=593\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Ba'al HaTurim to Bereshit 46:2</a>. There, the Tur mentions that when writing the word לישראל in a sefer Torah, seven crowns are placed upon the letter Shin as a sign that G-d would save Yaacov from 7 troubles.</p>\n\n<p>The letter Shin has 3 arms and also has a Mispar Katan value of 3.</p>\n\n<p>It is unclear what Al Berko is referring to in regard to the number 3 except that it may be a reference to the concept of chazaka. That repeating something three times establishes it as a fixed condition.</p>\n\n<p>He points to the idea that Yaacov was 84 years old when he actually married Leah and Rochel. When divided by 7 it results in 12, which could be an allusion to his comment that Yaacov stole the blessing of his brother, Eisav. </p>\n\n<p>According to Berko in the name of the Ari z\"l and the Ba'al Shem Tov, that included that Eisav would have been the father of the twelve tribes of Israel. Specific sources for those two references were not provided.</p>\n\n<p>And if 84 is divided by 21 (3 times 7), the result is 4 which could be a reference to G-d's four letter name, who saves Yaacov from his seven troubles.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p><em>Thank you for daring asking the question in big. As I understand, this site focuses on the Peshat level, and I'm getting a lot of critics for mixing the Drush in.</em></p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p>My answers are based on (<em>my understanding of</em>) what is called Derech Ha'Avoda (<em>in the way of the Divine Service(?)</em>), which is one of \"branches\" of the Drush (Kabboleh of you wish)[1]. It implies, that this world in general and every single level of it, just as every single person (Neshomah), has a mission to fulfill. The Mitzvos (explicit and implicit) and the Torah study are the ways to fulfill the missions, either by the way of performing it (think sacrifices) or studying about it (נשלמה פרים שפתינו). A proper fulfillment of a mission gets us to the next level, just like in video games, and the mission itself becomes \"obsolete\".<br>\n.<br>\nUsually those missions target a Tikkun (תיקון \"restoration\", maybe you use a better translation) of a certain aspect of the world after it was damaged by a sin. For example - the primordial sin (נחש) led to obligation of marital relations to restore the world to where it was before the sin. Once restored (fulfilled in the world to come), the mission becomes obsolete and the obligations are cancelled.</p></li>\n<li><p>Every Jew performs his part in the Tikkun of the world in different aspects, according to his innate strengths and destiny either consciously or not. The basic assumption to explaining the Torah according to this approach, is that our forefathers were deeply aware of those missions and their personal designation, and did their best to resolve them totally or, at least, lessen the remainder for the rest of the times. Even if we don't really understand how the Tikkun works, they did it; and each of their deeds was meant to fulfill a certain mission.<br>\n.<br>\nTherefore, by working 7 years for Lavan, Yaakov intended to fulfill a certain mission he was destined (more on that in another question), i.e \"to free the world of some kind of the Evil of Lavan\". He did it three times (7+7+6 years) overall.</p></li>\n<li><p>The Numbers: many ideas in Judaism are divided into a certain number of levels against the spiritual significance of that number.  Most famous are the numbers 10 (Sefirot), divided into 7 (lower) and 3 (higher), and 4 (letters of the Holy Hame). Each of them represents some kind of unity of subject \"on all levels\". For example, the 12 tribes (3 times 4) and the 12 hours and months and , as having 3 aspects (see Sefirot) and sub dividing into 4 (against the Holy Name) on each aspect.<br>\n.<br>\nFor example a week is divided into 7 days where each day represents a certain aspect (of Sefirot), hence the names Sun-day, Moon-day and up to Saturn-day. Although the work performed on each day is almost identical to another (with exception of Shabbos), the intentions (כוונות) are different, hence the Song of the Day.</p></li>\n<li><p>When a Tzaddik performs certain actions a certain number of times, he intends to complete a mission on all levels. For example, Yaakov bowed to Eisov 7 times, having different intentions each time, to remove Eisov's wickedness and it finally worked. Another example would be the 8 days of Mileh, to ensure that the newborn will get through all the types of days (7) before the Mileh for the circumcision to be successful.</p></li>\n</ol>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>After this preface, I can now understand, that <em>after</em> we know Yaakov worked 7 years (<em>and having in mind that he was in a great hurry to raise the 12 tribes as he was pretty old (77?), and could use his fathers wealth to marry the sisters</em>) we could suppose that he intended to lessen Lavan's Evil by performing certain yearly work 7 times (1 Shemitah). And that was needed also to be performed a total of 3 times - against Rochel, Leah and the cattle. Only when that was accomplished (I don't explain the missing 21st year) Yaakov could finally leave Lavan.</p>\n\n<p><em>[1] This tradition I learned personally from R' Moshe R.

Shmuel Wosner (Shevet Ha-Levi, vol. 4 no. 17) writes that <strong>this is\n  only a rabbinic prohibition and may be set aside so as not to\n  antagonize a non-observant Jew</strong>, particularly if he might otherwise eat\n  non-kosher food.</p>\n  \n  <p>R. Moshe Shternbuch (Teshuvos Ve-Hanhagos, vol. 1 no. 483) takes the\n  long view and states that <strong>kiruv, bringing a fellow Jew closer to\n  Torah, in the long run creates less violations than otherwise so it is\n  a good thing to offer a non-observant Jew food even if he will not\n  recite a blessing before eating</strong> [...]</p>\n  \n  <p>R. Shammai Gross (Shevet Ha-Kehasi, vol. 4 no. 329) writes that <strong>the\n  prohibition is only when one knows for certain that the person will\n  not recite a blessing</strong>.

Soloveitchik was a rising star, but he probably wasn't a well known opponent of the time. The view of a near contemporary is nevertheless relevant. </p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>Obviously, these aren't my views, and I am not endorsing them. I am answering the question of why some rabbis at the time, including the very influential Minhat Elazar and Satmar RAv, opposed it. This isn't the place to attack them, or their ideas.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# If God is infinitely good, why did He create finite people to bestow good to?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>Assuming God is absolutely good to the furthest extreme possible and there are no other worlds out there like ours (with torah observant creatures), if so, why did He create finite number of worlds to bestow this good to? Surely, He is capable of creating other worlds like ours whereby some at least will have peoples who are willing to accept His torah. On the other hand, would this prove that there must be other worlds out there like ours with creatures like us who received His torah?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>The basic answer to your question is that this is a hypothetical discussion and we cannot (at this point in time) <strong>know</strong> the answer as I will explain below. While we can say that Hashem's infinite goodness <strong>could</strong> lead him to create other worlds to bestow it on, we could also say that this good could require that any particular set of beings must be unique. Thus, once one set of beings (or universe) has been created, then that would be sufficient to receive the infinite good that Hashem bestows. It appears that Hashem specifically does not want us to know for sure because that would actually not be <em>good</em> for us.</p>\n\n<p>It appears to me that knowledge for sure would harm us just like Hashem allows for doubt even though we know that He exists and gave us the Torah. I am saying that I can come up with circumstances in which the good would be each possibility. Personally I think there probably are others, but say that it is intrinsically unprovable.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>I remember reading that by definition a created being <strong>must</strong> be finite in nature in order to exist. There cannot be two infinite beings. Additionally, for Hashem to bestow <em>good</em> upon the creation, that creation must lack something so that Hashem can bestow it on them. Only a finite being could lack something to begin with.</p>\n\n<p>If you are asking about a finite number of worlds being created, we do not know how many worlds with intelligent life have been created because the Torah only speaks about this world. Note that the Torah does not speak about nations that do not deal with Bnai Yisael even though they exist. Similarly, it would not need to speak about other worlds as they would not be relevant to what we are being taught.</p>\n\n<p>While Hashem <strong>could</strong> create other worlds, there is no way of proving the matter one way or the other. If Hashem has set up the universe to allow interstellar travel, then we might eventually find out. If He has set up the universe not to allow such travel, then we might never find out.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p><strong>Addendum</strong></p>\n\n<p>@mevaqesh reads your question as asking about an <em>infinite number</em> of such worlds as opposed to any finite number of such that may be. Indeed, this particular point could be addressed as a theoretical question. Isaac Asimov in one of his novels uses the concept of <em>two is an impossible number</em>. Thus, there <strong>could</strong> be an infinite <strong>number</strong> of finite universes or an infinite <strong>number</strong> of worlds within our universe (which would make it <em>infinite</em> is <strong>size</strong> though still finite as a creation) without changing the analysis of the question.</p>\n\n<p><strong>However</strong> the point that I was making was that the torah would not in any case address that question as it is referring <strong>only</strong> to this world and to those nations in this world that deal with the Bnai Yisrael. The fact that there may (or may not) be other worlds (or other universes) would not apply.</p>\n\n<p>Thus, the entire point is that while Hashem <strong>can</strong> create in any of these modes, it appears that it is best for us not to know for sure.</p>\n\n<p>Hashem providing infinite good <strong>can</strong> be taken to mean that He would therefore create as many beings as would <em>fit</em> into the universe(s), but as far as any individual group of beings would be concerned, that good would be provided to that group (like humans) alone.</p>\n\n<p>If it is best for beings (like humans) to get in contact with others who have free will, then Hashem would have arranged it (although apparently in the future -maybe after mashiach comes). It is quite possible that at our level of development it would not be a good idea to meet others who may have passed the test that Adam Harishon failed, or may be at a different level in their development.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.jewishmag.com/8mag/worlds/worlds1.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"> The Existence of Other Worlds By Baruch Crowley</a> speaks of the ideas of other worlds and that aliens on UFOs (if they exist) may be in the realm of non-free willed beings like the nachash is said to have been before the aitz hada'as.</p>\n\n<p>Chabad <a href=\"http://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/3012/jewish/Is-There-Life-on-Other-Planets.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Is There Life on Other Planets?</a> has the viewpoint</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Dr. Velvl Greene was a microbiologist who was enlisted by NASA in\n  their project to determine if there is life on Mars. He asked the\n  Lubavitcher Rebbe privately if this was something he should be doing.</p>\n  \n  <p>The Rebbe replied, “Dr. Greene, look for life on Mars! And if you\n  don’t find it there, look somewhere else in the universe for it.\n  Because for you to sit here and say there is no life outside of planet\n  Earth is to put limitations on the Creator, and that is not something\n  any of His creatures can do!”<sup>9</sup></p>\n  \n  <p><sup>9</sup> <a href=\"http://www.chabad.org/therebbe/article_cdo/aid/2436891/jewish/The-Rebbe-and-the-Scientist-Looking-for-Life-on-Mars.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">The Rebbe and the Scientist: Looking for Life on\n  Mars</a></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Indeed</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Several Torah scholars of past generations have discussed the\n  possibility of life on other planets. Rabbi Chasdai Crescas (Spain,\n  1340–1411) wrote that there is nothing anywhere in Torah that negates\n  such a possibility.<sup>3</sup> Rabbi Yosef Albo (Spain, 1380–1444),\n  on the other hand, disagreed.<sup>4</sup> Rabbi Pinchas Horowitz\n  (Poland 1765-1861), cites Albo, but rejects his thesis.<sup>5</sup></p>\n  \n  <p><sup>3.</sup> Ohr Hashem 4:5.</p>\n  \n  <p><sup>4.</sup> Sefer Ha'Ikrim.</p>\n  \n  <p><sup>5.</sup> Sefer HaBrit HaShalem 1:3, 4.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>Your question has many assumptions, some of which are accurate and some of which are not. Looking at each assumption may help.</p>\n\n<p>You open by saying that G-d is absolutely good to the furthest extreme possible. This is an accurate, traditional belief like is found in the language of the Shemonah Esreh blessing for the year where it says, \"because You are G-d, good and who does good...\"</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>כי אל טוב ומטיב אתה</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The next assumption, \"<em>there are no other worlds out there like ours (with torah observant creatures)</em>\", is according to a large segment of traditional Judaism not accurate. The concept that there are worlds <em>like ours</em>, meaning similar to ours is one of the foundations of Jewish belief. This idea is expressed in the text recited on Shabbat evening just before the Barchu that precedes Shema.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>כגונא דאנון מתיחדין לעלא באחד אוף הכי איהי אתיחדת לתתא ברזא דאחד למהוי עמהון לעלא חד לקבל חד</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Just as they unify above with <em>Echod</em>, thus, so too, He is unified below in the mystery of <em>Echod</em>. To make with them above, one to receive one...</p>\n\n<p>That each of these worlds, above and below, is like a fractal or chiral form to each other ultimately manifesting G-d's unity in an infinite form.</p>\n\n<p>And as the text continues, <em>This fulfills the mystery of G-d is one and His name is one.</em> That <em>name</em> (שם) is an abbreviation for heaven and Kingship (שמים ומלכות), meaning the spiritual domain of the angels above and our physical, material domain below, the earth.</p>\n\n<p>A similar idea is expressed in the blessings preceding morning Shema which mention how the ministering angels of Heaven listen to and parallel our words when reciting Kadosh, Kadosh, Kadosh, etc.</p>\n\n<p>This idea, that there are similar worlds, above and below, is part of G-d's system for the structure of all creation. It is based on a kabbalistic doctrine related to the doubling letters in the Hebrew alphabet. The explanation of this can be found in Sefer Ginat Egoz by Rabbi Yosef Gikatilla.</p>\n\n<p>The next assumption is in the form of a question asking, \"<em>why did He create finite number of worlds</em>\". Even here, the premise is not in keeping with many traditional Jewish teachings found in the <a href=\"http://chabadpedia.co.il/index.php/%D7%A2%D7%95%D7%9C%D7%9E%D7%95%D7%AA_%D7%94%D7%90%D7%99%D7%9F_%D7%A1%D7%95%D7%A3\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">kabbalah and Chassidut</a>. </p>\n\n<p>The finite worlds, which are described generally in Torah as the worlds of <em>Briah</em>, <em>Yetzirah</em> and <em>Asiyah</em>, correspond to the structures of the courtyard and enclosure of the Mishkan and Mikdash. These also correspond to human physical action, emotional qualities and intellect. The Heichal and Tent of Meeting correspond to the world of <em>Atzilut</em>, which is infinite, but is still a named world. Aztilut also corresponds to the soul, Neshamah. What is called <em>Worlds without end</em>, is referring to those unnamed worlds which precede Atzilut like is mention by Rabbi Chaim of Chernovitch in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Be'er_Mayim_Chaim,_Genesis.1.1.73?vhe=Be%27er_Mayim_Chaim,_Jerusalem_1991.&lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Be'er Mayim Chaim to Bereshit 1:1:73</a>. They correspond to the Holy of Holies in the Mishkan and Mikdash and the <em>Pintele Yid</em> of the Jewish soul, which is described in <a href=\"https://he.wikisource.org/wiki/%D7%AA%D7%A0%D7%99%D7%90_%D7%97%D7%9C%D7%A7_%D7%90_%D7%91\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Tanya</a> as <em>a piece of G-d above literally.</em> (חלק אלוה ממעל ממש)</p>\n\n<p>So there are other worlds with creatures similar to us according to traditional Jewish belief. And that leads to your closing question about if they received the Torah? And this is answered by the text of the blessing that we are required to make before reciting words of Torah each day.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>אשר <strong>בחר בנו מכל העמים</strong> ונתן לנו את תורתו</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>That G-d <em>chose us from all the nations</em> and gave us His Torah.</p>\n\n<p>That Israel is the one nation, meaning the nation of <em>oneness</em> who unifies G-d's name, like is expressed in the Shomer Yisrael prayer said in Tachanun which says:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>שומר גוי אחד, שמור שארית עם אחד, ואל יאבד גוי אחד, המיחדים שמך כו׳</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>And this relates back to your opening question about why G-d created finite people to bestow good upon. One of the ideas associated with creation, is that one of the purposes behind creation is to reveal G-d's Kingship like is expressed on Rosh HaShanah. And like the expression of our Sages, <em>There is no King without a nation</em> like is found in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Kad_HaKemach,_Rosh_HaShanah.2?vhe=Kad_HaKemach,_Warsaw_1872&lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Kad HaKemach of Rabbeinu Bechaye, Rosh HaShanah 2:3</a>.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>אין מלך בלא עם</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>There are other ideas related to this, like that Kingship within the Torah is also expressed through the King caring for, meaning bestowing good, to His people.</p>\n\n<p>Another reason mentioned is that the purpose of creation is that we know Him, knowing in the sense that Adam knew Chava (Bereshit 4:1 והאדם ידע את-חוה אשתו). And since He both fills and transcends all worlds, ממלא כל עלמין או מלכותך מלכות כל עלמין וסובב כל עלמין, then to truly know Him, one must acquire both those aspects. And this is accomplished through learning Torah and fulfilling the mitzvot like is discussed in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Tanya,_Part_One,_The_Book_of_the_Average_Men.37?vhe=Tanya_-_Otsar_HaChasidim_Lubavitch&lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Tanya 1:37:2</a> and also by the Tzemach Tzedek in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Derekh_Mitsvotekha.1?vhe=Wikisource&lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Derech Mitzvotecha 1:31</a>.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>The main issue isn't Infinite/finite, it's Perfect/imperfect; created/Non-Created.

They say that the first verse refers to the father and the son, since they read \"the word of YHVH to the Lord\" with a <em>kamats</em> in the <em>nun</em> [i.e. אֲדֹנָי rather than אֲדֹנִי], and they say: How can YHVH speak to \"the Lord\"? It must be that they are two, and the spirit is third. And another mistake they make in reading this psalm: They read \"with you (עִמְּךָ) is generosity\" with a <em>chirik</em> [rather than \"your nation (עַמְּךָ) is generosity\"].

If there was a replacement, it's inappropriate to say \"he will not change his mind.\" (He also brings reasons based on Malachi 3:22 in support of the Torah not changing, but this is only a side point to this psalm.)</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>V. 5: The implication is that Jesus would fight wars, but Jesus didn't fight any wars</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>V. 6: If Jesus only came to save souls, he shouldn't be killing people</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>V. 7: This verse says \"he will raise his head,\" but to this day Jesus hasn't \"raised his head\" (returned)</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Can a mourner attend a Torah lesson on Shabbat?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>A mourner within the first seven days is forbidden to learn Torah (see e.g., <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/q/51294/11501\">here</a> on MY). But can such a mourner (passively) attend a Torah lesson (<em>shiur</em>) on Shabbat?</p>\n\n<p>I saw this happening when a mourner came into synagogue before Shabbat morning prayers and walked in the middle of a Torah class.</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Can he sit down to wait for prayers to start and listen passively?</li>\n<li>Should he walk out again until the <em>shiur</em> ends?</li>\n<li>Is the answer different on weekdays if for some reason there is no <em>minyan</em> in the <em>shiva</em> house? (since on Shabbat public displays of mourning are forbidden)</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>Regarding a passive act that indicates mourning, The Tur (YD 400) writes that Rabbenu Tam would regularly get a particular <em>aliya</em> to the Torah. When he was a mourner, they didn't call him, but he went up anyway, since his absence would be considered \"public\" mourning which is generally forbidden on Shabbat. It seems from this, that even not engaging in Torah study can be considered public mourning. Thus, if one's absence will be noted, it seem likely that one should attend the <em>shiur</em> on Shabbat. Otherwise, it seems likely that one ought to refrain from showing up for the <em>shiur</em> (or even walk out if it wouldn't be noticed).</p>\n\n<p>Additional views are cited in the Beit Yosef there. To summarise: according to R. Isaac of Dampierre, there is no prohibition of studying Torah on Shabbat, since Torah gladdens and one must be happy on Shabbat. According to Rabbenu Tam and Hagahot Maimoniyot, there is a general prohibition to study on Shabbat, but it is permissible in public. According to Rabbenu Tam, passively not learning is considered public mourning if it will be noticed, and thus, although Torah study is prohibited, if one's absence will be noted, he should study. According to the Hagahot Maimoniyot, however, it would be better to leave rather than engage in Torah study even if one's absence will be noted.</p>\n\n<p>Thus, according to R. Isaac one should certainly attend the lecture, according to Rabbeu Tam, one should attend if his absence would be noticed, and according to the Hagahot Maimoniyot, one should not attend the lecture even if his absence will be noticed. The Beit Yosef notes that R. Isaac is a minority view whom halakha does not follow. Although he doesn't take a stand on the dispute between Rabbenu Tam and the HM, in the Shulhan Arukh he only mentions the view of RT, and neither he, nor Rema mention the HM's suggestion of having someone leave rather than participate in Torah study. Instead, the more popular view seems to be that if a lack of Torah activity will be perceived as mourning, then it should not be avoided.</p>\n\n<p>Regarding the question of whether listening to a lecture would be the same as learning actively, it should be noted that according to many many Rishonim, including Yereim, Ritva, and Rambam (as understood by R. Rabinovitch), the mitsva of Torah study applies to non-verbal study. This is the opinion of numerous Aharonim such as the Yeshuot Yaakov, R. Yaakov Emden, R. Kook, and R. Soloveitchik, to just mention a few (see <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/a/57293/8775\">here</a>).</p>\n\n<p>Accordingly, it is not clear why there would be any distinction between looking at something yourself, reading it, or listening to someone else reading it.</p>\n\n<p>Furthermore, even according to the apparently minority view who holds there is no mitsva in non-verbal study, it is not at all clear that that would have any bearing on the question at hand, as the prohibition is likely due to the fact that Torah gladdens a person, as is the reason for the prohibition on the 9th of Av (see Ta'anit 30a) in which case Torah study that doesn't happen to fulfill a mitsvah would likely be equally banned.</p>\n\n<p>Regarding whether or not the prohibition relates to Torah gladdening a person, see Tosafot Moed Kattan (21a s.v. V'assur) which discusses the view of R. Isaac of Dampierre, regarding the opposite question; learning Torah that saddens a person. Originally he suggested that one should be strict, since unlike the prohibition on the 9th of Av, the prohibition of a mourner isn't explicitly stated to be due to happiness. However, later he ruled that is is based on happiness, and that one may learn depressing things. Tosafot notes that this is similarly the implication of the Yerushalmi. </p>\n\n<p>Similarly, many Aharonim assume that the prohibition is due to joy. These include K'li Y'kar to Genesis (27:41), Kitsur Shulhan Arukh (210:1), and Yalkut Yosef (YD 22:6).</p>\n\n<p>Accordingly, there would be even less reason to suspect that this would be any different from any other Torah study, and would presumably be forbidden. </p>\n\n<p>Alternatively one could suggest what amounts to a new <em>derasha</em>. The prohibition for a mourner to study Torah is based on Ezekiel's instruction to be silent (Ezekiel 24:17), as stated by Rambam in Hilkhot Evel (5:15) based on Moed Kattan (15a). Accordingly, Torah study that is silent is permitted. In my opinion this line of reasoning is not compelling.</p>\n\n<p>In light of the above, I see no reason why \"passive\" study would be any less forbidden. Indeed, R. Yitshak Yosef has a related discussion in Yalkut Yosef (YD 22:11). He writes that a mourner may not think Torah thoughts. He suggests that there might be room for leniency on Shabbat (as noted above, according to some there is no prohibition of Torah on Shabbat at all), but nevertheless writes that one should refrain from this.</p>\n\n<p>Importantly, he writes (22:10) that one could be lenient to learn Torah on Yom Tov.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>Edit: I now see that some of these points (but few of these sources) are mentioned in <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/a/88142/8775\">this</a> post.</p>\n\n\n### ✅ Antwort 2 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>The Shulchan Aruch rules (Orach Chaim 47:4):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>הַמְהַרְהֵר בְּדִבְרֵי תּוֹרָה, אֵין צָרִיךְ לְבָרֵךְ:  הַגָּה: וְה''ה\nדְּיָכוֹל לִפְסֹק דִּין בְּלֹא נְתִינַת טַעַם לִדְבָרָיו  (רַ''ן פ''ק\nדְּשַׁבָּת וּפֶרֶק כָּל הַצְלָמִים כָּתַב דְּהָוֵי כְּהִרְהוּר).</p>\n<p>‎One who considers words of Torah does not need to bless.

Instead one must actively verbalize the words of torah to qualify as limmud Hatorah.</p>\n<p>The Shulchan Aruch HaRav (Hilchos Talmud Torah 2:12) says this explicitly:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>״וכל מה שלומד בהרהור לבד ואפשר ולהוציא בשפתיו ואינו מוציא אינו יוציא\nבלימוד זה ידי חובת מצות ולמדתם אותם וכמ״ש לא ימוש ספר התורה וכו׳ והגית\nבו יומם ולילה, וכמו בכל המצוות התליות בדיבור שאינו יוצא ידי חובתן\nבהרהור אא״כ שומע מפי המדבר שהשומע כעונה בפיו וכו׳ ‏ולכן כל אדם צריך\nלהיזהר להוציא בשפתיו להשמיע לאוזניו כל מה שלומד בין במקרא משנה ותלמוד\nאא״כ בשעת עיון להבין דבר מתוך דבר.</p>\n<p>When one is contemplating his learning, and has the ability to\nverbalize, yet does not, does not fulfill his obligatory mitzvah of\n“and you shall teach them to you children... and recite them day and\nnight...and this is so just as other mitzvos that are dependent on\nspeech that it is not sufficient just to contemplate, rather one must\nverbalize them...therefore one must be careful to actively verbalize\nhis learning loud enough to hear himself, whether it is Chumash,\nMishna or Gemara. However the above does not apply if one is deeply\ncontemplating his learning to understand the subject better.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The Mishna Brerurah (5) goes so far as to require someone who is learning a from a Sefer quietly to make sure to verbalize some of the words he is learning.</p>\n<p>The Piskei Tshuvos (note 51) actually suggests that one who is listening to a shiur on the phone or a recording device is not fulfilling the mitzvah of Talmud Torah - thus one should actively verbalize the words.</p>\n<p>Seemingly according to the above, it would technically be permitted for a mourner to attend a shiur, but as long as the mourner does not verbalize any of the Torah he is hearing.</p>\n<p>However, there is a reason to forbid it nonetheless, as one could suggest that since the whole prohibition of learning Torah during mourning is because it brings joy - perhaps even listening to Torah would bring joy. Thus it would be forbidden.</p>\n<p>On top of that one could also add the opinion of the Vilna Gaon that contemplation of Torah is a mitzvah, and thus would for sure be forbidden for a mourner to attend a shiur.</p>\n<p><em><strong>The ideas above may not be relied upon without consulting a Rabbinical Authority</strong></em></p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# An apparent contradiction in Ralbag's philosophical methodology\n\n## Frage\n\n<p><a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/86704/deviations-of-ralbag-from-normative-jewish-theology\">This discussion</a> about Ralbag reminded me of an apparent contradiction in Ralbag's Torah/Philosophy methodology.</p>\n\n<p>At the end of his introduction to <em>Wars of the Lord</em> ('מלחמות ה) he writes:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The reader should not think that it is the Torah that has stimulated\n  us to verify what shall be verified in this book, [whereas in reality]\n  the truth itself is something different. It is evident, as Maimonides\n  (may his name be blessed) has said, that we must believe what reason\n  has determined to be true. If the literal sense of the Torah differs\n  from reason, it is necessary to interpret those passages in accordance\n  with the demands of reason. Accordingly, Maimonides (may his name be\n  blessed) explains the words of the Torah that suggest that God (may He\n  be blessed) is corporeal in such a way that reason is not violated.\n  He, therefore, maintains that if the eternity of the universe is\n  demonstrated, it would be necessary to believe in it and to interpret\n  the passages of the Torah that seem to be incompatible with it in such\n  a way that they agree with reason. It is, therefore, evident that if\n  reason causes us to affirm doctrines that are incompatible with the\n  literal sense of Scripture, we are not prohibited by the Torah to\n  pronounce the truth on these matters, for reason is not incompatible\n  with the true understanding of the Torah. The Torah is not a law that\n  forces us to believe false ideas; rather it leads us to the truth to\n  the extent that it is possible, as we have explained in the beginning\n  of our commentary on the Torah. (Seymour Feldman translation.)</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>However, in Book 1 Chapter 14 he writes:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>If anyone thinks that religious faith requires a conception of human\n  perfection different from the one we have mentioned because of certain\n  passages about the Garden of Eden and Gehenna in various Midrashim,\n  Aggadot, and statements of the prophets, let him surely know that we\n  have not assented to the view that our reason has suggested without\n  determining its compatibility with our Torah. For adherence to reason\n  is not permitted if it contradicts religious faith; indeed, if there\n  is such [a contradiction], it is necessary to attribute this lack of\n  agreement to our own inadequacy. Hence, it is clear that someone who\n  believes this [i.e., the view of the Torah] should follow his\n  religious convictions. We, too, behave accordingly if we see that\n  religion requires a different view from the one that our reason has\n  affirmed. This is incumbent upon all the faithful; for if the door\n  were open to any philosophical doubt with respect to religion, the\n  religion would disappear and its benefits for its adherents would\n  vanish. Moreover, [all kinds] of controversies and confusion would\n  arise among the believers unless there is faith, and as the\n  result of this, definite harm will come about. This fact should not be\n  overlooked. This point that we have made here should be understood as\n  applying to every other part of our book; so that if there appears to\n  be a problem concerning which our view differs from the accepted view\n  of religion, philosophy should be abandoned and religion followed. The\n  incompatibility is to be attributed to our shortcomings. (Seymour\n  Feldman translation.)</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Can these two seemingly contrary approaches to the Torah/philosophy conflict be reconciled?</p>\n\n<p>(Side question: In Chapter 14 the translator has a footnote explaining that in the introduction Ralbag gives a different emphasis. However, in the introduction he does not have a footnote explaining that in Chapter 14 Ralbag gives a different emphasis. Can this be taken as evidence that the translator felt that the introduction was the truer representation of Ralbag's view?)</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>Dr. Nima Adlerblum appears to address this in <em>A Study of Gersonides in his Proper Perspective</em> Chapter Four:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>When Gersonides' motive reveals itself to us, the reading of his work becomes easier and more enlightening. We begin to understand, for instance, why at times he tells us that science must be put above the teachings of the Torah, and at other times that the Torah must have the upper hand on science. Critics of Gersonides have gathered one or the other set of statements, according as they wanted to prove him a liberal or an orthodox. <strong>In reality Gersonides pronounces the two diametrically opposite statements in one breath.</strong> When we enter into his attitude of mind we realize why they do not appear contradictory in his eyes. \"The Torah does not force us to believe an untruth\" is continually repeated by Gersonides. But the full meaning is not grasped unless we realize that he at the same time means that <em>the truth is contained in it</em>, — one must seek it until it is discovered. This is the keynote to Gersonides' philosophy, namely, that science, the theoretical explanation of the world, and the Torah, the experience of the Jewish people, — both reveal at bottom the same truth through a different language. The truth of the Torah needs for its realization to be both experienced by the Jewish people and to be verified by science. Science is the key to the Torah. On the other hand the Torah being the ground whereby man is led to his highest perfection, it must help him also to reach the truth in deep subjects which are hard to grasp. If such is the nature of the Torah it is self-understood that it would not lead us to believe that which is not true. <strong>The truth of the Torah and that of science are exactly on the same level, and are not complete unless verified by each other.</strong> They stand in the same relation as sense-experience to reason. (My bold; italics in original)</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>Perhaps the answer is that there is no contradiction because the two statements are addressing two different (types of) people.</p>\n\n<p>Both statements are based on the premise that the purpose of the Torah is to lead man to the greatest possible truth/perfection.</p>\n\n<p>Ralbag always maintains that the Torah and philosophical truth cannot actually be discordant. His statement in the introduction is telling us that the Torah can (and should) be reinterpreted to conform to our philosophical findings. However, this can only be done by someone who can appreciate that the Torah is not bound to its strict literal interpretation. For such a person, the correct thing to do is to interpret the Torah based on philosophy.</p>\n\n<p>However, there are people who cannot imagine that the literal meaning of the Torah can be false, while still being a perfect Divine book. For such people, \"reinterpreting\" the Torah in light of philosophy is <em>nolens volens</em> a rejection of the Torah's perfection. For such a person, says Ralbag, it would be inappropriate to implement the strategy outlined in the introduction, because it would result in the rejection of the Torah as a whole which would be the loss of the guiding light towards perfection/truth. In other words, Ralbag is saying that it is better for this person to sacrifice the truth in a specific instance in order to maintain the overall truth. Since the specific truth in question and the general truth of the Torah are both meant to lead the person to the same goal (ultimate perfection) it makes more sense to give up the specific truth in order to maintain the overall truth.</p>\n\n<p>(This is perhaps akin to the argument of the Sefer HaChinuch as to why we have to follow the Sages, and the majority, when it is possible for them to err – namely, that it is better to have a working system with a few mistakes than to have no system at all.)</p>\n\n<p>Chapter 14 is directed to this latter person. This is perhaps supported by the fact that Ralbag in Chapter 14 emphasizes that the person <strong>believes</strong> that the Torah obligates a certain position (when in reality the Torah does not, as per the introduction), and that the consequence of \"reinterpreting\" the Torah is to have no guide to perfection at all.</p>\n\n<p>(One challenging phrase for this approach is \"כי גם אנחנו ננהג כן\" in Chapter 14.)</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>Without having any sources other than the quotes themselves, this was how how I understood the Ralbag's position on reason vs revelation.</p>\n\n<p>In the introduction, he is talking about not believing that which was proven to be impossible. The topic is truth vs falsehood. Which is why his examples are Hashem's incorporeality, or the hypothetical case of an eternal universe (in particular, one that always existed).</p>\n\n<p>In 1:14 the Ralbag is talking about where one obtains one's values, and \"a conception of human perfection\". What Ought Be rather than what the introduction's discussion of what Is. When it comes to values, there is little one can logically disprove, so the introduction's point wouldn't apply. And we do at times suspend our judgement about what is right in deference to the answers Hashem revealed to us.</p>\n\n\n",

For injustice shall cover his garment, said the Lord of Hosts, but you shall beware of your spirit, and do not deal treacherously.”</em></p>\n\n<p>Translation reported on the website www.sefaria.org:</p>\n\n<p><em>“For I detest divorce—said the LORD, the God of Israel—-and covering oneself with lawlessness as with a garment—said the LORD of Hosts. So be careful of your life-breath and do not act treacherously”</em></p>\n\n<p>The meaning changes radically between the two translations. Which is the one that according to Jewish tradition is to be considered the most reliable?</p>\n\n<p>The meaning \"I detest divorce\" seems to me hardly compatible with the wide interpretation given by Beit Hillel regarding the \"ervat davar\" clause in Deuteronomy 24: 1,while Beit Shammai's more restrictive position on the subject would appear to me to be more coherent. </p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 5)\n\n<p>The meaning of this verse is discussed in the <a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/shas.aspx?mesechta=19&daf=90b&format=pdf\" rel=\"noreferrer\">last page of Gitin</a> (<a href=\"http://halakhah.com/gittin/gittin_90.html\" rel=\"noreferrer\">English</a>). The translation on chabad.org, \"If you hate [her], send [her] away\" follows the opinion of Rabbi Yehuda, who interprets the verse in exactly those words: \"If you hate her, send her away.\"</p>\n\n<p>Rabbi Yochanan interprets the verse, \"One who sends away is hated\" (or in the variant quoted in Mesorat Hashas as well as Rashi: \"If she is hated by God, send her away\"). According to the Gemara, Rabbi Yehuda and Rabbi Yochanan's opinions can be reconciled: The opinion that \"one who sends away is hated\" refers to one's first marriage, and \"if you hate her, send her away\"/\"If she is hated by God, send her away\" refers to one's second marriage.</p>\n\n<p>The translation \"For I detest divorce\" on sefaria.org more closely follows Rabbi Yochanan (though not literally), and is also closer to the literal meaning of the Hebrew (following the Masoretic vowelization). The reason why the chabad.org translation follows the opinion of Rabbi Yehuda is probably because that is the opinion quoted by Rashi on the verse, although Rashi on that verse also mentions that there is a dispute.</p>\n\n\n",

This is my holiness and this is my rest.\" <strong>And for the sake of the Sabbath, he was saved from the punishment of hell.</strong> Once a person saw the power of the Sabbath, he came to say a hymn for the Sabbath, a song for the Sabbath day.

    "content": "# How to keep the kitchen clean while observing Shabbos?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>I know someone who has great difficulty observing Shabbos correctly, because she is very accustomed to using a sponge to clean dishes, and a sopping wet rag to clean kitchen surfaces (which are constantly getting very dirty due to serving several children food throughout the day). Leaving the sink full of dishes, or leaving kitchen surfaces dirty, are not acceptable to her because it is disgusting. Using a Shabbos scrubber with cold water doesn't wash dishes well enough for her (it doesn't get off fat or oil, for one thing). Just placing everything in the dishwasher is not a solution, because they need to be cleaned somewhat first for the dishwasher to be effective (requiring the sponge), and because many of her kitchen items can't go in the dishwasher.</p>\n\n<p>My question is: How, as a practical matter, do people who are fully Shabbos-observant deal with cleaning kitchen surfaces or washing dishes on Shabbos without violating prohibitions such as squeezing and using the hot water faucet? Given the information above, how would you advise the person to transition to observing Shabbos while keeping the kitchen as clean as she likes?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 6)\n\n<p>I would agree that Shabbat clean-up can pose some challenges, and it's not just because of various <em>melachot</em>. When you have a lot of company, the hosts really don't want to spend hours cleaning in the kitchen.</p>\n\n<p>The easiest solution - something I have been doing for numerous years - is to cook everything you can in disposable aluminum tins and use disposable paperware / plasticware and disposable tablecloths. For those who want things to look \"fancy\", you can find fancy colorful paperware and plastic spoons, knives, forks that look almost like fancy silverware. Granted, not everything can be cooked in disposable tins, but, they can be warmed in them (including soup, if you  warm it before Shabbat starts.)</p>\n\n<p>Once you're done with your meal, roll up everything in the tablecloth and it goes in the trash. Your left-over food is in the tins for the day meals. The point is, there are no dishes or pans to wash.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>I clean kitchen counters with a spray (like Fantastic or Simple Green) and a pre-cut paper towel. This is effective and permitted as long as the paper towel does not become wet enough to get squeezed.</p>\n\n<p>Dishes CAN be washed effectively in cold water using a high-quality dish soap like Dawn Platinum. There are different types of Shabbos sponges, some are more effective than others. <a href=\"http://aaajudaica.com/product/shabbat-sponge/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\" title=\"This\">This</a> one, imported from Israel, is one of the best. Experiment to find the one that works best for you.</p>\n\n<p>I know someone who fills a dish basin with hot water before Shabbos. She then covers it with aluminum foil. After the Friday night meal, she washes the dishes using the still-warm water. Alternatively, she soaks them in the hot soapy water.</p>\n\n<p>(Disclaimer: I am not being paid to advertise for any specific products. For this specific question I felt the information would be helpful.)</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>A solution might be to begin to use cold water (turning off the hot water heater helps if one has a tendency to forget)and with a proper scraper, or hands, remove food from dishes then place the dishes in the dishwasher to be turned on after shabbat. Counters can be dripped with cold water, provided the water isn't picked up by anything absorbant, just move the water off into a plastic bowl. Since this is, as you say, making a beginning to keeping shabbat, maybe a good time to CYLOR.</p>\n\n\n",

The offering for\n  worshipping idols in ignorance was only a she-goat, whilst for other\n  sins an ordinary person brought either a ewe-lamb or a she-goat (Lev.\n  iv. 27-35), the females bring, as a rule, in every species, inferior\n  to the males. There is no greater sin than idolatry, and also no\n  inferior species than a she-goat. The offering of a king for sins\n  committed ignorantly was a he-goat (ibid. vers. 22-26), as a mark of\n  distinction. The high priest and the Synhedrion, who only gave a wrong\n  decision in ignorance, but have not actually committed a sin, brought\n  a bull for their sin-offering (ibid. ver. 3-21), or a he-goat, when\n  the decision referred to idolatry (Num. xv. 27-26). The sins for which\n  guilt-offerings were brought were not as bad as transgressions that\n  required a sin-offering. The guilt-offering was therefore a ram, or a\n  lamb, so that the species as well as the sex were superior in this\n  latter case, for the guilt-offering was a male sheep. For the same\n  reason we see the burnt-offering, which was entirely burnt upon the\n  altar, was selected from the superior sex; for only male animals were\n  admitted as burnt-offerings.

To illustrate, let me describe the first side of the first page of the first tractate, B'rachot.  It begins with a mishna, which asks: from what time in the evening can we recite the Sh'ma?  The mishna then answers by saying from the time the <em>kohanim</em> enter their houses to eat <em>t'rumah</em>; these are the words of R' Eliezer.  The mishna then presents other opinions and an anecdote, and then there's a discussion of the general principle in interpreting \"midnight\".  That's all in the first paragraph, just a few sentences in the Hebrew.  The g'mara then begins to deconstruct this, asking where we learn these various points.  The g'mara discussion of this mishna continues for eight (double-sided) pages of compact Aramaic.</p>\n\n<p>Beginners working alone should expect to struggle with this, even in translation.  The discussions assume a knowledge of <em>halacha</em>, Jewish law, and familiarity with the <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/a/10874/472\">rules of exegesis</a> (derivation).  It is akin to reading a college-level mathematics text before you've learned algebra -- you might learn something from it here and there, purely as a matter of chance, but you'll miss most of what \"learning talmud\" entails and you won't learn the underlying concepts.  And -- this is something that's different in Judaism than in other contexts -- studying talmud is almost universally done with a study partner, because studying it together and discussing it leads to deeper understanding and discipline.</p>\n\n<p>If you want to learn talmud, I recommend that, instead of diving into a talmudic discourse, you learn <em>about</em> the talmud, its structure, its key players, and its methods of exegesis.  Books such as R' Adin Steinsaltz's <em>Essential Talmud</em> provide an accessible introduction to the topic.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>A good introduction to Talmud study, is study of the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mishnah\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Mishna</a>, since the Talmud is a commentary on many Tractates of the Mishna.

    "content": "# Is there a reason to prefer giving a child single name over multiple names?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>From biblical times through at least the Geonic period and perhaps until as late as the Chasam Sofer Jews gave their children a single first name. It seems to be a relatively late idea to give a child more than one 'first' name. It is my understanding that the name Shnuer was created as a contraction of the words 'shnei ohr' (two lights) when a question arose about naming a child after someone named Uri and someone else named Meir. The solution, to create a new name, came about because of the hesitation or unwillingness to simply give the person two names. </p>\n\n<p>Is there any religious reason to prefer giving a single name and if so does anyone explain why there was a shift from giving a single name to multiple names? </p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 8)\n\n<p><a href=\"http://download.yutorah.org/2009/1109/735718.pdf\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Rabbi Aryeh Lebowitz has a long piece on this here.</a> Here is the main part but it is well worth reading the whole section V starting on page 15:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Giving two names under normal circumstances.\n  While Rav Yechezkel Landau and Rav Moshe Sofer\n  don’t explicitly forbid giving two names, their tone\n  suggests negative feelings toward this custom.\n  Additionally, the Chazon Ish is reported to have\n  disapproved of the custom to give two names (even though he had two names himself). No reason is\n  offered for this opinion, but presumably it is due to\n  the resulting complexities in the laws of gittin and\n  because it is a relatively recent custom. It seems\n  that the Chazon Ish is somewhat of a da’as yachid\n  on this matter, as the custom to give multiple\n  names is very prevalent and has not been met with\n  any criticism from other leading poskim. In fact,\n  Rav Moshe Feinstein was reported to have ruled\n  that although it was certainly inappropriate to start\n  such a practice, since it is not forbidden, any\n  rabbinic objection would certainly go unheeded.</p>\n  \n  <p>Giving two names after two different people.\n  Assuming that there is no objection to giving a\n  child multiple names, Sefer Bris Avos cites The Rav\n  of Staratin who says not to name a child after two\n  different people. In light of the custom to do so,\n  Bris Avos suggests that this authority merely\n  meant that one should not name his child for two\n  people who did not get along with each other in\n  their lifetimes. This ruling is most likely based on\n  kabbalistic considerations.\n  Another consideration when giving two names\n  after two different people is that the combination of\n  the two names may be considered a third,\n  independent name, and may not be considered to\n  be after the two people who originally had those\n  names. This point seems to be the subject of\n  conflicting views of the rabbis.</p>\n  \n  <p>Rabbi Eliezer Silver went so far as to rule that\n  somebody named Yitzchak Isack may name his\n  child Avraham Yitzchak, as the different\n  combination is clearly a totally different name. He proved this from the pesukim at the end of\n  Parshas Matos where the torah says that Yair\n  the son of Menashe went and captured villages\n  (chavos) and these villages were renamed\n  Chavos Yair. In contrast the next pasuk states\n  that Nobach captured Kenat and called it\n  Nobach “after his name”. The addition of the\n  phrase “after his name” suggests that only in\n  Nobach’s case where the name remained\n  exactly the same is it considered “after his\n  name”. In Yair’s case where the title Chavos\n  was added, it is not considered to be “after his\n  name”.</p>\n  \n  <p>The Da’as Zekeinim M’ba’alei Hatosafos point\n  out that Yoseph named his son Ephraim after\n  both Avraham and Yitzchak. Avraham refers to\n  himself as efer (ashes) and Yitzchak was like\n  efer (ashes) on the mizbeach. The name\n  Ephraim means “two efer’s (two people\n  referred to as ashes)”. Implicit in this\n  comment is the notion that one may name for\n  two different people, even if each name is\n  changed. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>The halachos of gitten can become complicated when more than one name is given.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Shulchan_Arukh%2C_Even_HaEzer.129.1?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rama EH 129:1</a></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>כּוֹתְבִין שֵׁם הָאִישׁ וְהָאִשָּׁה, בַּגֵּט. וְאִם יֵשׁ לְאֶחָד מֵהֶם שְׁנֵי שֵׁמוֹת, כּוֹתְבִין שֵׁם שֶׁהֵם רְגִילִים>  בּוֹ וְיוֹדְעִים בּוֹ בְּיוֹתֵר, וְכוֹתְבִים: אִישׁ פְּלוֹנִי וְכָל שֵׁם שֶׁיֵּשׁ לוֹ גֵּרַשׁ אִשָּׁה פְּלוֹנִית וְכָל שֵׁם שֶׁיֵּשׁ לָהּ; וְאִם כָּתַב חֲנִיכָתוֹ וַחֲנִיכָתָהּ, כָּשֵׁר. הַגָּה: וְכָל שֶׁכֵּן אִם כָּתַב עִקַּר הַשֵּׁם לְבַד, דְּכָשֵׁר, וְלָכֵן אֵין לְהַקְפִּיד עַל הַכִּנּוּיִים כָּל כָּךְ. וְיֵשׁ אוֹמְרִים דְּאֵין לִכְתֹּב כָּל שׁוּם שֶׁיֵּשׁ לוֹ, אֶלָּא אִם יֵשׁ לוֹ שְׁנֵי שֵׁמוֹת יִכְתֹּב: פְּלוֹנִי דְּמִתְקְרֵי פְּלוֹנִי (רַבֵּנוּ תָּם וּבֵית יוֹסֵף בְּשֵׁם הָרַמְבַּ''ן וְהָרַשְׁבָּ''א), וְכֵן נוֹהֲגִין, וְאֵין לְשַׁנּוֹת. וַאֲפִלּוּ נִכְתַּב הַגֵּט אֵין לְגָרֵשׁ בּוֹ, אַף עַל פִּי שֶׁכָּתַב: כָּל שֵׁם, עַד שֶׁיִּכְתֹּב שְׁנֵי הַשֵּׁמוֹת (בְּקוּנְטְרֵס). לֹא כָּתַב אֶלָּא שֵׁם הָאֶחָד, אֲפִלּוּ הוּא שֵׁם הַטָּפֵל, וְגֵרַשׁ בּוֹ, כָּשֵׁר (טוּר):</p>\n<p>They write the name of the man and the woman on the get (that is, the divorce document).

Based on the Dictionary of <a href=\"https://www.avotaynu.com/books/dagn.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Ashkenazi Given Names</a> by Alexander Beider, section 1.2 <em>Several Names Borne by the Same Individual</em>, pp. 1 - 13, one finds that there are several different cases of such names. Here's the summary of the chapters:</p>\n<p><strong>A case of Sacred Name (שֵם הַקֹדֶש) and a Vernacular or \"Secular\" Name (כִּנוּי).</strong></p>\n<p>The Sacred name is the one that a person is using in the synagogue. The Vernacular name is the one a person is using in the non-Jewish world. The oldest examples can be found in TaNaKh. Esther is known as Hadassa. Daniel, Chanahia, Mishael, and Azaria received new names in Bavel. This pattern continued through the times of Gemara and into our days. However, the vernacular names have not been used in the synagogue setting, until later times. Due to many troubling events in European history many people forgot or did not have their Sacred names, so that Yiddish or other language vernacular names started being used as Sacred.</p>\n<p>I also heard that the custom to recite a verse corresponding to one's Sacred name was established so that people in modern times could remember their names, even though in kabbala this idea was suggested a few hundred years before.</p>\n<p><strong>Cases of two independent Sacred names</strong></p>\n<p>A wel know case of two independent sacred names is in the Torah: Yaakov and Yisrael. Cases of two independent sacred names appear in gemara as noted by Zunz (1837) <a href=\"https://sammlungen.ub.uni-frankfurt.de/freimann/content/titleinfo/335\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Namen der Juden</a>, p. 28:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Matthia-Levi, Thaddai-Juda, Joseph-Ise (Joma f. 52b), Mehalalel-Jehuda (ib.), Johanan-Joseph (Gittin f. 34b), Acha-Ajamare (ib. f. 35a), Sara-Mirjam (ib. f. 34b).</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>In the Ashkenazi records the earliest cases of two sacred names are found in late 1200s-early 1300s based on the available information. After the Middle Ages, the custom of using two Sacred names became much more common. The principal reason is that the Jewish population grew. Using two names allowed for more combinations. Certain Biblical names are extremely common: Avraham, Yitzchak, Yaacov, Yisrael, Yoseph, Yehuda, Moshe, Aharon, Shmuel, David, and Shlomo for men; Sarah, Rivkah, Leah, Rachel, Miriam, Channah, and Esther for women. Using double names allowed to distinguish individuals by these names.</p>\n<p>Another reason, it is common to give names of the deseased relatives to the children. Using double names allowed to combine the requests of both spouses or other people in naming the child.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Cases of three or very rarely four sacred names</strong></p>\n<p>Such cases started to appear in mid-1600s-1700s in Germany, Austrian Empire, Poland, and Lithuania. However, they were not common.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>After division of Poland in 1790s, a large population of European Jewery started living in the Russian empire. Over the course of 1800s  Jewish people received their last names.  Due to requirements of military draft, Russian officials made an agreement with Rabbis that people should be given one name, as they had difficulty identifying people with several first names given a certain last name. As a result, the number of people with multiple names in the Russian Empire was reduced. Likely, it started the custom that mother names first two sons, father names first two daughters, and then they switch.</p>\n\n\n",

Shulchan Aruch <a href=\"http://beta.hebrewbooks.org/tursa.aspx?a=oc_x1560\" rel=\"noreferrer\">316:3</a>), the SA rules (<a href=\"http://beta.hebrewbooks.org/tursa.aspx?a=oc_x1563\" rel=\"noreferrer\">ibid .12</a>) that it is permitted to entrap an animal or bird that is domesticated and obedient. Likewise, a child cannot be considered any less obedient which does not either entail hunting or capturing, rather it is considered <em>watching</em>, not <em>hunting</em>.  </p>\n\n<p>The same argument can be applied to restraining a thief; it would be considered watching and not hunting. </p>\n\n\n### ✅ Antwort 2 (Score: 5)\n\n<p>Chacham Ovadia holds there is no issur of Tzeida (trapping) by humans (Cf.

Leviticus 5:15), in the Bible it is used in the context of multiple sorts of other transgressions. For example, besides for this example of a woman cheating on her husband, it is used in reference to monetary crimes against regular people (Leviticus 5:21), taking the forbidden spoils of Yerikho (Joshua 7:1).[i] It is also used for sin more broadly (cf. Leviticus 26:40, Ezekiel 39:23) and idolatry in particular (I Chronicles 5:25).</p>\n\n<p>So what does the word mean?</p>\n\n<p>Metsudat Tsion (Ezra 9:2) explains it to mean sin, and Rabbenu Bahya (Leviticus 5:15) explains that it means a deliberate transgression in particular. These fit in the context of the sotah, as does your proposed definition of \"breaking faith\". Unlike a husband who can marry multiple wives, a wife is limited to a single husband, and thus effectively violating her contract with her husband through relations with another man.</p>\n\n<p>On the plane of derush, the commentary <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/q/62378/8775\">attributed</a> to <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asher_ben_Jehiel\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Rosh</a> to Number (5:12) interprets it as saying that she sins against God (who is called 'ish').</p>\n\n<p>Alternatively, Panim Yafot (there) suggests that she sins against her husband by bringing punishment to him in accordance with Sotah (4b) which states that \"immorality in the house brings poverty to the house\".</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>[i]  According to the peshat, this wasn't like the Temple or its vessels; just forbidden (Cf.

I have not been able to find this Peshat anywhere though, which really bothers me, as that likely means there is something <strong>clearly</strong> wrong with it, but I can't figure out for the life of me what that is!</p>\n\n<p>It fits very well for a number of reasons.  Firstly, we have similar words meaning the same thing (see Devarim 19:3), it would explain why Avram cut the animals and not the birds. It would explain why he knew to cut them without Hashem telling him. It would also explain why the word pieces and not halves is used in the continuation.</p>\n\n<p>So I'm looking for a source that mentions this Peshat, and/or something that would disqualify it directly.  </p>\n\n<p>Edit: I spent a while researching it last night myself, and I think I may have an answer, but I really don't like it, so I'd like to see what others come up with first.</p>\n\n<p>Edit: Thanks to mevaqesh for suggesting that I make a list of all commentaries I have checked, even if they do not comment here or on this in specific point.  While I don't remember all of them, I'll start a list (in no particular order):\nTargum Onkelos, Targum Pseudo-Yonasan, Targum Yerushalmi, Rasag, Rashi, Ri Kara, Rashbam, Ibn Ezra, Bechor Shor, Chizkuni, Radak, Ramban, Ibn Caspi, Seforno, Kli Yakar, Kesav VehaKabbalah, Malbim, Netziv, RDZ Hoffman, Abarbanel, Rabbeinu B..., Or Hachaim, Alshich, R' Chaim Paltiel, Daas and Hadar Zekeinim, R' Hirsch, Mendelssohn, Reggio, Professor Artom, Living Torah, various Christians/Christian translations, etc.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>Ralbag on this pasuk explains that it was the way of covenant-makers to cut animals in half and walk between the two halves which somehow symbolized the coming-together of the two parties. If that is the case then it wouldn't make sense to cut the animals into three pieces, because the whole point is to specifically have two halves.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>ר\"ל שחלק הבהמות לחצאים כי כן היה דרך כורתי ברית שהיו חולקין דבר אחד\n  לחצאים והיו עוברים בין החלקים ההם להורות על שהם שבו כמו גוף אחד לחוזק\n  האהבה אשר ביניהם</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Similarly in Jeremiah 34:18 we see a covenant that involved cutting the calf into two pieces. Several of the commentaries there point out (like Ralbag) that this was the way of covenant-makers.</p>\n\n<p>Radak</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>כן היא דרך כריתת הברית וכן ברית אברהם בין הבתרים</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Metzudas Dovid </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>וחוזר ומפרש שכרתו העגל לשני חלקים ועברו בין החלקים כי כן היה דרך כורתי\n  ברית וכמ\"ד בברית בין הבתרים ויבתר אותם בתוך וכו</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Although none of these commentaries provide a source that this was the standard way of making covenants, see <a href=\"http://www.thectp.org/notes/inheritance/inheritance_2.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">this article</a> about ancient covenants which states:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>As the ceremony started, the representatives would take the animal\n  sacrifice and cut it down the middle from head to tail. The <strong>two\n  pieces</strong> of the sacrifice were laid open with the bloody side facing\n  upward. Since the animal was usually quite large, a significant amount\n  of blood would escape, flowing toward the center of the <strong>two pieces</strong>\n  of the sacrifice (p.24, emphasis added).</p>\n  \n  <p>As the two representatives walked between the <strong>two pieces</strong> of the\n  sacrifice and faced each other, they would look to heaven and say\n  something like this: “Do so to me as has been done to this animal if I\n  break this covenant. If I fail to keep this covenant, may I die even\n  as this animal has died” (p. 26, emphasis added).</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: -1)\n\n<p>You ask for an explicit showing that the animals were divided in half and not into three parts. Rav Hirsch explains the three as tripling in great detail (which is too long to go into). He shows that the usage of the term משולש means tripling as in the phrase חוט המשולש. That is it means that the significance and symbolism of each animal is to be tripled and that is why the division of the animals shows that three generations will be oppressed. There are also others who explain this but I will concentrate on him for the usage.</p>\n\n<p>The following pasuk <a href=\"http://www.chabad.org/library/bible_cdo/aid/8210#v=10&showrashi=true\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Lech Lecha 15:10</a> would seem to show the reason <code>that would disqualify it directly.</code> Thus Rav Hirsch seems to explain that the torch going between the (two) pieces shows the promise as to what will happen. Indeed we see from some of the explanations of the avodas zarah (going between two lines of fire) that this is meant to show a dedication and a promise. Since the fire went between the animals, Hashem was making the promise.</p>\n\n<p>The fact that the division is not referenced until pasuk 15:10 also shows that the term משולש does not mean split into three parts as the animals were to be taken משולש and later divided.</p>\n\n<p>Rav Hirsch says </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>As שַלֵש means to do something three times, חוט המשולש (Eccl. IV.12) a\n  threefold cord, the משלשת and משלש here can also mean nothing bu three\n  times, three calves, three goats, and three rams.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.chabad.org/library/bible_cdo/aid/8210#v=10&showrashi=true\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Lech Lecha 15:10</a></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>וַיִּקַּח־ל֣וֹ אֶת־כָּל־אֵ֗לֶּה וַיְבַתֵּ֤ר אֹתָם֙ בַּתָּ֔וֶךְ\n  וַיִּתֵּ֥ן אִֽישׁ־בִּתְר֖וֹ לִקְרַ֣את רֵעֵ֑הוּ וְאֶת־הַצִּפֹּ֖ר לֹ֥א\n  בָתָֽר:</p>\n  \n  <p>And he took for Him all these, and he divided them in the middle, and\n  he placed each part opposite its mate, but he did not divide the\n  birds.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Rav Hirsch translates this as</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>And he took all these unto Him, and He divided them in the centre, and\n  He laid each piece opposite its corresponding piece, but the birds divided \n  He not.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Rav Hirsch says that the subject of וַיְבַתֵּ֤ר is Hashem and not Avraham and that Hashem was doing the dividing. However, we see that it is a breaking apart and not a tearing into three parts.</p>\n\n<p>Looking at Rashi and Rav Hirsch (as an example), we see that בַּתָּ֔וֶךְ is translated by Rav Hirsch as <code>in the center</code> and the pieces are explicitly placed with a path in the center for the smoking torch to go between.</p>\n\n<p>Rav Hirsch explains:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>וַיִּתֵּ֥ן אִֽישׁ־בִּתְר֖וֹ לִקְרַ֣את רֵעֵ֑הוּ the divided parts were\n  laid down each part opposite its corresponding part so that it was\n  apparent they were waiting to be joined together again, that is why\n  וְאֶת־הַצִּפֹּ֖ר לֹ֥א בָתָֽר is added there.  Just the power to soar\n  upwards remaining unbroken was what was necessary for the hoped for\n  reunion of these broken powers.</p>\n  \n  <p>\"And then, when the sun had gone down and complete darkness had set,\n  lo, it was a smoking furnace and a torch of fire - it had been a\n  refining and an enlightening - which had temporarily kept these pieces\n  apart\" (עבר not עובר) - the purification was completed, the\n  enlightening had worked, the broken parts were joined again.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

(פרק טז, ו)   <strong>משחקים בשבת אמנם, יש להעיר באופן\n  כללי לגבי המשחקים בשבת, על פי הנאמר במדרש ובתלמוד הירושלמי, שהייתה \n  עיר אחת שנענשה בגלל שהיו משחקים בה בכדור בשבת</strong> (הובאו הדברים בערוך\n  השולחן אורח חיים סימן שח). האחרונים הסבירו מדרש זה, שגם לפי השיטה שאין\n  איסור לשחק בכדור, הם נענשו משום שזה היה עיקר עיסוקם בשבת, במקום לעסוק\n  בתוכן הרוחני של השבת (תפילה, לימוד, משפחה וכו').   בזה נוגעים בכלל\n  גדול בתורה הצריך ביאור נפרד, והוא - רוח ההלכה. כלומר, גם דברים המותרים\n  – לפעמים נוגדים את רוח ההלכה וצריך להימנע מהם.   לכן, גם בנושא משחק\n  הפינג פונג, מותר לשחק בו בשבת בזמן מוגבל, אולם צריך להיזהר שהמשחק לא\n  יהיה עיקר השבת הן מבחינת הזמן והן מבחינת חשיבותו. כל טוב (משיב: הרב\n  שמואל שפירא, רבה של כוכב יאיר)</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>And <a href=\"https://www.yeshiva.org.il/ask/7624\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a> as well.</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Regarding Nidda Issues see <a href=\"https://www.yeshiva.org.il/wiki/index.php?title=%D7%94%D7%A8%D7%97%D7%A7%D7%95%D7%AA_%D7%9E%D7%90%D7%A9%D7%AA%D7%95_%D7%A0%D7%93%D7%94\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a> as well:</li>\n</ul>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>ומשחק פינג-פונג – עי' שו\"ת משנה הלכות ח\"ה סי' קנ שהחמיר בזה בניגוד\n  לדעת הבאר משה (רבי משה שטרן זצ\"ל מדערבצין) ח\"??? סי' מט אות ה</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.star-k.org/images/publication-halachos-niddah.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rav Moshe Heineman</a> permits playing ping pong with ones wife when she is in Niddah, nevertheless he warns against it become קלות ראש:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>לשחק משחק \"פינג-פונג\" וכדומה, לית ביה משום הושטה,</p>\n  \n  <p>אמנם פעמים דיש בו משום קלות ראש</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>He quotes the Be’er Moshe:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>ט. עי' בשו''ת באר משה )ח''א סי' נ' אות ה'( מש''כ דאין לאסור זה כיון\n  דמתחלה צריך הכדור שיגע בשלחן קודם שיגע אל מי שכנגדו.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>However Rav Heineman adds that even without that sevara it would be permitted, as the whole point of the game is for the other person to <em>not</em> catch the ball:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>אמנם למעשה נראה  דבלא''ה פשוט דמותר, כיון דכוונת המשחק הוא דוקא שלא \n  יקבל האחר הכדור</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>On whether it is appropriate to play ping-pong (table tennis) on Shabbat <a href=\"http://dinonline.org/2011/08/14/ping-pong-table-tennis-on-shabbos/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">dinonline</a> writes</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>There is no formal prohibition on ping pong.

Thus the title applies to the person whose name is being stated and not to his father. As an example, if a baby (not Jewish) is adopted by a cohen or a Levi, then he is called to the torah as Gershom ben Moshe and not Gershom ben (Moshe haLevi).</p>\n\n<p>An interesting point is that even though Moshe Rabbeinu was considered a Cohen, his sons were not cohanim but were leviim and would be called to the torah that way - (Gershom ben Moshe) haLevi.</p>\n\n<p>A woman does not have this possibility, so she would be referred to in her kesuvah or her get as bas Ploni haCohen.

When such a child is called to the Torah with his grandfather's name, he is treated like an adopted child since he is not the member of a tribe.</p>\n\n<p>This shows that the usage of the phrase is on the person and not the father.

[Meaning: he isn't to be considered a member of the Pharasaic / Rabbinic class.]</p>\n  \n  <p>Rabbi Shemu'el bar Nachmeini said: He is a boor [implying more coarseness than a mere ignoramus].</p>\n  \n  <p>Rabbi Yanai said: He is [like a] Samaritan.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Similar to another gemara (Berakhos 47b) which states:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>תניא אחרים אומרים: אפילו קרא ושנה ולא שימש תלמידי חכמים, הרי זה עם הארץ. אמר רב הונא הלכה כאחרים</p>\n  \n  <p>It was repeated (in a <em>beraisa</em>), \"others say\" [ie Rabbi Meir said]: Even if someone studied and reviewed, but did not serve sages, that one is an ignoramus.</p>\n  \n  <p>Rav Huna said: the law is like \"others\".</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>So, someone with an on-line <em>semichah</em> without apprenticeship apparently shouldn't be giving halachic rulings, as it risks being classed an evil trickster whose decisions bring ruin. (I say \"apparently\" because I myself do not feel sufficiently apprenticed to say something firm that could be taken as a ruling!)</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>There is no real semicha nowadays anyways. 'Smicha' was a chain of teachers ordaining students tracing itself all the way back to Moshe Rabbeinu. This chain was purposefully lost due to corruption. Thus, there are no real Halochas of smicha. Today, a rabbi can give a talmid smicha as he sees fit.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>One of the most respected rabbis in Baltimore tells that he received smicha from Ner Yisroel's rosh yeshiva, Rav Yaakov Weinberg z\"l. The Rosh Yeshiva generally didn't give smicha, the test was usually given by Rav Kulefsky z\"l. But this rabbi had never bothered to take the exam, even though he taught one of the regular study groups on the subject at Ner! One day he was speaking to Rav Weinberg, and he mentioned that he had never taken the exam. \"You have smicha, ___, you have smicha!\" said Rav Weinberg. And that was that.</p>\n\n<p>That is what smicha means these days; it's also called \"yoreh-yoreh\" (see Sanhedrin 5a): permission to rule on the relevant halachic issues. Once the teacher determines that the student is ready to do that - however he determines it - he can give smicha. Obviously a responsible teacher wouldn't do that without knowing the student well. But that can be done online too.</p>\n\n<p>Not quite \"online\", but another friend told me that he was part of a training program by Rav Moshe Heinemann shlit\"a in the Star-K. A question would come by phone; if he felt comfortable, my friend would answer it. If he had any issue, he would transfer the question to Rav Heinemann and listen to the answer. Kind of a phone apprenticeship. Of course, he had regular smicha already.</p>\n\n\n",

One of them is one who wishes to give Tzedakah himself but does not wish others to follow suit for one of two reasons. 1) He does not wish that others also partake in Olam Habah and does not want others to have a Shem Tov. 2) He wants the poor to stay relatively poor and not suddenly climb up to his ranks.</p>\n\n<p>The Mishnah continues with another level in Tzedakah and that is one who wishes that others give and get the reward and help the poor but also wants it not to be at the expense of his wallet.</p>\n\n<p>The Meforshim all point out that these two people although the Mishnah categorizes both them as possessing an ayin ra'ah they take on different meanings as explained above and both display a bad midah which the other one does not.</p>\n\n<p>The Tiferes Yisroel in reference to the one who wishes he were the only one to give Tzedakah that this is an Avon Pelli meaning a harrowing and atrocious sin. Whereas on the next he does not stick on such language.</p>\n\n<p>These words shout \"it is far worse to wish on to others not to be righteous than not being righteous yourself\".(When discussing a real transgression as Chilul Shabbos it may be different and needs to be thought as that which the punishment went to the one who did the transgressor rather than the one who wanted and enabled him to transgress does not have to mean that it is greater.)</p>\n\n<p>Now the one who is leaving first leaving the dirty work for the other fellow so that he is the good guy with the clean slate does not remain with a clean slate and would be even worse than the last one to leave.</p>\n\n<p>In other words, letting the other be the class clown will leave you being the clown up there and remember the shame up there is eternal.  </p>\n\n\n",

For example, he does not keep Yom Tov Sheini in Chutz La'aretz.

It is very difficult to argue that one who rejects the Rabbinic authority to enact binding legislation in direct opposition to their professed authority isn't disputing the spokesmen of the Oral Torah.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/911896/jewish/Teshuvah-Chapter-Three.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Mishneh Torah, Teshuvah 3:8</a></p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>The Talmud's own definition of the term is one that denigrates a talmid chacham so I would think that there is no greater denigration than publicly flouting their laws.</p>\n<p>Bavli Sanhedrin 99b:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The mishna teaches that those who have no share in the World-to-Come include an epikoros. Rav and Rabbi Ḥanina both say: This is one who treats a Torah scholar with contempt.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>There are various types of \"heresies\" in Judaism. The terms apiqores, kofer, mumar, min, etc. denote different ideologies and thought processes, but are often today colloquially referred to as \"apiqorsuth\" or \"kefirah\". With that caveat in mind, rejecting the Oral Law is indeed considered to be heretical from the vantage of traditional rabbinic Judaism. The Rambam categorizes it as a type of kefirah b'torah (denial of the Torah). In H. Teshubhah 3:8[17] he writes:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>שלושה הן הכופרים בתורה:  האומר שאין התורה מעם ה', אפילו פסוק אחד,\nאפילו תיבה אחת--אם אמר משה אמרו מפי עצמו, הרי זה כופר בתורה; <strong>וכן הכופר\nבפירושה, והיא תורה שבעל פה, והכחיש מגידיה, כגון צדוק ובייתוס</strong>; והאומר\nשהבורא החליף מצוה זו במצוה אחרת, וכבר בטלה תורה זו, אף על פי שהיא\nהייתה מעם ה', כגון הנוצריים וההגריים.  כל אחד משלושה אלו כופר בתורה.</p>\n<p>There are three individuals who are considered as one \"who denies the\nTorah\": a) one who says Torah, even one verse or one word, is not from\nGod. If he says: \"Moses made these statements independently,\" he is\ndenying the Torah. b) <strong>one who denies the Torah's interpretation -\nthat is the Oral Law, or disputes its transmitters as did Sadoq and\nBaytus.</strong> c) one who says that though the Torah came from God, the\nCreator has replaced one mitzvah with another one and nullified the\noriginal Torah, like the Hagarenes and the Christians. Each of these\nthree individuals is considered as one who denies the Torah.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Accordingly a person who \"only keeps the Rabbinic laws that make sense to him\" is categorized as a Kofer b'Torah. This person is rejecting the rabbinically transmitted perush (explanation of the Torah) and the authority by which it comes down. Such a stance is what the Karaite heresy historically argued for, echoing its early predecessors Sadoq and Baytus. That it did not have a problem with the idea of rabbinic interpretation per se - but felt that such interpretation was not authoritatively binding. That a person may reason independent of the Oral Law and come to a contrary and practiced conclusion. This movement was roundly condemned as heretical by rabbinic Judaism throughout history, and this view continues to be deemed a type of kefirah (denial).</p>\n\n\n",

Mature trees would be created with the appropriate number of tree rings. The atmosphere would have been created with the appropriate ratio of gases (including isotopes).</p>\n\n<p>Carbon 14 dating <strong>assumes</strong> some initial proportion of carbon 14 to carbon 12 and that it had been decaying using that half life ever since.</p>\n\n<p>As a result, it can only be use to calculate age back to the moment of creation at which point the object being dated came into existence with all of the appropriate properties.</p>\n\n<p>Similarly, people argue that Adam <em>did not</em> have a navel because he was created fully mature (and so did not have an umbilical cord to cut) while others argue that he did because, being created fully mature, he would have shown all the evidence of how he had grown (including a navel).</p>\n\n<p>As a result of this, the carbon dating process can only be accurate (to some extent) after creation and can be used only to show how Hashem wants the world to appear for ages more that. Note that 5778 is used as the time since the creation of Adam based on his life span and the following years so that it has no meaning for the <em>time</em> before that.</p>\n\n<p>The idea is that Hashem set up the world in order to show what the <em>laws of nature</em> are designed to be. However, by definition, creation from nothing would have the world appear fully made with all <em>evidence</em> intact at the moment of creation.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>A more precise wording of your question is that, as the article mentions, carbon-14 dating places a tree at over 9,500 years old, just as it places many other items much earlier than that. This is a known question about carbon-14 dating and the age of the earth.</p>\n<p>Many people take different approaches towards this. (And this has presumably been asked elsewhere even on this site.) And yes, one popular approach (which I can agree with personally) is that the 6 Days of Creation were not 24-hour days.</p>\n<p>Other approaches can be (a) that the Torah is false, (b) that the science is false, (c) that we don't understand something elsewhere in Biblical chronology, e.g., the long lifespans which gives us the current year as 5778.</p>\n<p>Here is one possible alternative I devised myself, just to show you that the 6-Days as non-24 hours days is not the inexorable conclusion.</p>\n<p>Carbon-14 dating is based on a half-life of carbon 14. Namely:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Once the organism dies, however, it ceases to absorb carbon-14, so that the amount of the radiocarbon in its tissues steadily decreases. Carbon-14 has a half-life of 5,730 ± 40 years—i.e., half the amount of the radioisotope present at any given time will undergo spontaneous disintegration during the succeeding 5,730 years. Because carbon-14 decays at this constant rate, an estimate of the date at which an organism died can be made by measuring the amount of its residual radiocarbon.</p>\n<p>The carbon-14 method was developed by the American physicist Willard F. Libby about 1946. It has proved to be a versatile technique of dating fossils and archaeological specimens from 500 to 50,000 years old. The method is widely used by Pleistocene geologists, anthropologists, archaeologists, and investigators in related fields.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>It is extrapolation based on what is currently observed as to carbon-14's decay rate. So going back only <strong>once</strong> gives us a very eerie number, 5,730 ± 40 years, which is 5770. (Reminder that this year is 5778). When the method was discovered in 1946, this was 5706. It is only when we start calculating into that second half-life that we get something that contradicts literal biblical age of the earth.</p>\n<p>I am not saying that this is <strong>the</strong> answer, or a correct answer. Just that there are plenty of possible answers out there.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>Rashi clearly says that all trees were created at all different levels of maturity.</p>\n<p>First of all, the verses themselves seem to  contradict each other. First it says that Hashem created all vegetation, then it says, later, after Adam was created that \"no vegetation had grown\", so which one was it?</p>\n<p>Rashi brings from the Midrash that the trees and vegetation were created underneath the ground, but didn't grow until Adam prayed for rain (see rashi there)</p>\n<p>One might say that the trees were wiped out during the flood, but not all of them, and one of the biggest proofs for that is that the dove Noach sent out brought back an olive leaf \"ripped off, in its mouth\" and instantly Noach knew that the (1 year long) flood had subsided</p>\n<p>If the trees were all wiped out, that means that the leaf would have had to have grown from a brand new tree that would have grown sometime from the last months of the flood to the end of the flood, a period of only a few months, and olive trees in general don't grow that fast. Although it could have been a miracle, there's no mention of it. Although the dove could have grabbed a leaf off the surface of the water, or from another fallen tree, that wouldn't have caused Noach to know, by looking at the leaf, that the flood had subsided, so its mentioned in the commentaries that there has to have been a noticeable difference between a leaf sitting on the water for a year and a leaf that had been freshly picked off of an olive tree, so that shows not all of the (bigger) trees were wiped out, and Rashi already said before that the vegetation grew to all levels of maturity when Adam prayed for it, whic hthat itself is brought from a midrashic source, well before anyone started claiming the world to be older than 5781 years based on tree rings..</p>\n\n\n",

I did not know this person and I was in a public setting so I was uncomfortable to go over to him and explain what he was doing violated halacha. </p>\n\n<p>I'm sure socially awkward situations like this happen all the time. </p>\n\n<p>Based on the principle that all Jews are guarantors for one another I understand that I should simply go and tell a person when I see him or her doing something that violates halacha, but in practice, in my experience, I don't see that happening very often. </p>\n\n<p>What is some good advice on how to overcome the social awkwardness around correcting someone's behavior? Please only cite examples that you have personally seen/used successfully or reliable sources. </p>\n\n<p>Note I am only asking about correcting a mistaken or inadvertent transgression, not rebuking someone   </p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 6)\n\n<p>I have been corrected on several occasions, so I can describe what worked better or worse for me.  I've tried to apply this when I'm doing the correcting (doesn't happen often), and so far it has seemed to work, i.e. not caused upset.</p>\n\n<p>First, the more private, the better.  Sure you're at a <em>kiddush</em>, but there's a difference between walking up to the person in the middle of a group chat and pulling him aside.  Even if you're overheard, the attempt at discretion matters.</p>\n\n<p>Second, treat it as a <em>knowledge</em> issue, not a <em>behavior</em> issue.  Bad: \"Why are you handling <em>muktzeh</em>?\"  Better: \"Isn't such-and-such <em>muktzeh</em>?\" or (for someone who might not know what <em>muktzeh</em> is) \"Do you know about the laws of handling objects on Shabbat?\"  Both of my options leave open the possibility that the person <em>doesn't know something</em> (either the law or its application to a particular object, in this example).  We all have gaps in our knowledge, so no big deal!  Fix it and move on.</p>\n\n<p>Third, use humility.  Even if you're sure he's doing something wrong, <em>ask questions</em> or <em>invite a discussion</em> instead of jumping to the conclusion.  There might be something you don't know -- <em>dan l'chaf zchut</em>, give the benefit of the doubt.  And, more pragmatically, people respond better when they don't think they're being accused, so don't accuse until you need to.  Further, maybe <em>you'll</em> learn something from <em>him</em> -- how a different community <em>poskens</em> if he's a visitor, a <em>machlochet</em> you thought was settled but isn't, or an obscure exception to the usual <em>halacha</em>.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>I would leave all shul \"issues\" to the rabbi. If the person was a one-time guest, chalk this up to ignorance. I know what you're saying about the \"responsibility\", but, practically, there's only so much that you can do. Even the rabbi can't do much for an outsider. In my shuls, we get many non-religious outsiders whenever there is a Bar / Bat Mitva. Some of them have their cell phones go off during service. That's a shul decorum issue, so the rabbi just politely announces from the bimah, \"we request that you silence your cell phones.\" That's easy. We also have a pamphlet about shul decorum and procedures. Hopefully, people will read it, and obey. But, of course, the rabbi can't stop someone from turning on or off the light in the rest room on Shabbat.</p>\n\n<p>If he's a regular attendant, the rabbi may have some influence. Either way, the rabbi probably knows halacha better than you and he's also the official \"spiritual educator\".</p>\n\n<p>I'm not a rabbi or even close. But, a close friend of mine who has been a congregational rabbi told me what I think is the most practical \"kiruv\" advice that I've heard from anyone. He says that in terms of both a rabbi's interest as well as a congregant's interest, esp. a non-religious one, he wants to ascertain that the congregant will continuously attend his shul rather than have him attend the competitor which may be less religious, or worse, not attend at all. What he said may sound selfish or unconventional to many people, but, this method has worked very well for him, and in his several decades as a rabbi in about 8 different shuls, I can say that he has successfully kept at least 100 people.</p>\n\n\n",

Here are the totals:</p>\n\n<p>21 Descendants of Re’uven   46,500</p>\n\n<p>22-23 Descendants of Shim‘on    59,300</p>\n\n<p>24-25 Descendants of Gad    45,650</p>\n\n<p>26-27 Descendants of Y’hudah    74,600</p>\n\n<p>28-29 Descendants of Yissakhar  54,400</p>\n\n<p>30-31 Descendants of Z’vulun    57,400</p>\n\n<p>32-33 Descendants of Efrayim    40,500</p>\n\n<p>34-35 Descendants of M’nasheh   32,200</p>\n\n<p>36-37 Descendants of Binyamin   35,400</p>\n\n<p>38-39 Descendants of Dan    62,700</p>\n\n<p>40-41 Descendants of Asher  41,500\"</p>\n\n<p>42-43 Descendants of Naftali    53,400</p>\n\n<p>You see that all these numbers end in 0, and, if you ask me, this is not a coincidence, and it is not rounding (for example 35401 can be rounded to 35400), cause I believe that these are exact numbers. This is not (just) a numerology question but search for some deep reasons of why tribes had their men twenty years old and over who were subject to military service all as they are rounded to be multiples of 10 (or 50, if you want)?</p>\n\n\n",

I have also noted that the commentaries on the Mappah in basar b'cholov and ta'aruvos often cross-reference what the Rema wrote in Toras Chattas and seldom reference the Darkei Moshe, even when what he wrote in Darkei Moshe seems to be more similar to what he wrote in the Mappah, leading me to wonder if the Darkei Moshe was merely less accessible, or perhaps it was written afterwards and therefore is not assumed to be as relevant in the development of what made it into the Mappah.</p>\n\n<p>I am also aware that the Taz in Y.D. 106 cites the Toras Hachattas as asking a question on what the Mechaber writes in Shulchan Aruch, which would mean that Toras Hachattas was written after Shulchan Aruch was published. In order for Toras Hachattas to predate the Mappah would mean it had to have been between the publishing of Shulchan Aruch and the writing of the Mappah, which I understand to be a fairly narrow window of time.</p>\n\n<p>Looking for authoritative sources.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 8)\n\n<p>Bet Yosef <em>Orach Chaim</em> first appeared in 1550 (<em>Yoreh Deah</em> in 1551; <em>Even HaEzer</em> in 1553; <em>Choshen Mishpat</em> in 1558). In R. Isserles' intro. to <em>Orach Chaim</em> he writes that in the middle of compiling his grand work <em>Darkei Moshe</em> the BY appeared and so he refrained from continuing and instead reviewed R. Karo's work in a critical fashion, critiquing and supplementing where he saw the aforementioned work lacking. Ergo, DM's initial compilation began prior to 1550. However, it is important to further note that in the intro. (ibid) he informs us that he consequently began reviewing his original work, <em>Darkei Moshe</em>, essentially preparing a second edition. We therefore may be compelled to believe that the material of <em>Darkei Moshe</em> is a synthesis of pre-1550 work and also post-1550.</p>\n\n<p>In a responsum (§131), R. Isserles attests that the <em>Mappah</em> (glosses to <em>Shulchan Aruch</em>) was authored after the <em>Darkei Moshe</em> as the former was based on, and apparently culled from, the latter.</p>\n\n<p>Rav Isserles signs in his intro. to <em>Toras HaChattas</em> that he authored the work in 1568 (and first pub. in 1569, three years before his leaving this world).</p>\n\n<p>In summation, it appears that the chronological order of the noted works is as follows: <em>Darkei Moshe, Mappah, Toras HaChattas</em></p>\n\n<p>However, <a href=\"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yitzhak_Nissim\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">R.

Once they have a negative label placed on them, you can pretty much do whatever you want to them, and the public will view it as “they had it coming.” In this passuk, the Mitzriim do just that to the Jews - they are a problem.

Therefore the citation about deliberation and planning is appropriate.

R. Nattan b. R. Yosef of Clermont similarly writes in his commentary to the Haggada[i] that it means they presented the Jews as being bad, and treated them as such. Hadar Z'Kenim of the Tosafits to Exodus (1:10) and Abravanel to Exodus (ch. 1) write this as well.  This explanation is also quoted by the Beit Halevi to Exodus (1:9) and presented by R. YD Soloveitchik as quoted in Har'rei Keddem (2010) Vol. II pg 233.</p>\n\n<p>Another answer is that Pharaoh is reasoning with the nation of Egypt see וַיֹּ֖אמֶר אֶל־עַמּ֑וֹ. Similarly, 'נתחכמה' is in the plural, meaning that he was proposing that they participate. Apparently, rather than merely ordering them to comply, he convinced them to participate themselves. Accordingly, the verse serves as a proof-text for the intent on the Egyptians as a whole. This is supported by Rav Sa'adya Gaon who writes regarding this line in the Haggada that Pharaoh and the Egyptian people were in agreement. (Haggadat HaGeonim V'HaRambam pg. 185).</p>\n\n<p>Another less satisfying answer to the second question, it isn't a full proof about all Egyptians, but not was the statement necessarily about all Egyptians in the first place. Pharaoh was unquestionably part of the Egyptian oppression, and he is therefore a proof for what was done by (some) Egyptians, even if not all.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>[i] Printed in Moriah (257-9) (1999) pg. 16.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>(Pseudo-)Malbim offers an approach in his commentary on the Haggadah.</p>\n<p>The Haggadah is not bringing the verse in Shemot to explain what וירעו means.

To that extent I heard that the correct translation would be He called, rather than \"and He called\" (unlike [chabad translation])<a href=\"http://www.chabad.org/library/bible_cdo/aid/9902/jewish/Chapter-1.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">1</a>.\nIf so, why does targum translate ukra? which would indicate vav hamoseif?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>The וַ (plus the dagesh in the yodh) is called \"waw consecutive\".  At one time it was thought that this converted the verb from future to past, and the waw was called \"waw conversive\".  We now know that the yiqtol form of a verb does not always indicate future and the qatal form does not always indicate past. </p>\n\n<p>In prose, the wayyiqtol form is usually used to continue a narrative that was begun with a regular qatal form.  In this case, the qatal and the following wayyiqtol generally do refer to the past.  (Probably, the wayyiqtol form is a fossilized form that was originally a preterite form, as in Akkadian.  The difference between the preterite and imperfect yiqtol was lost when short final vowels were lost in Hebrew.)</p>\n\n<p>Since waw consecutive is not the same as waw conjunctive, it does not necessarily mean \"and\".  (None of this was known to author of the Targum.)  However, it's not possible to use both a waw conjunctive and a waw consecutive on one word, so whether the writer intends \"and\" or not, the form will still be wayyiqtol. In a narrative, a conjunctive often makes sense (\"this happened and then this happened and then...) so translators have to make choices. Most (but not all) modern translators avoid using \"and\" so often that it sounds annoyingly repetitive. Robert Alter, however, believes that the writers intentionally used the repetition of waw to put a rhythm into the text, and therefore he does translate \"... and ... and ... and ...\".  In the particular case of Wayyiqra, however, there may be a literary issue to be considered.  Since, as I mentioned, the wayyiqtol form is the continuation of a narrative, it may be that it was intentionally used at the start of the book to emphasize its close connection to what came before (i.e., Exodus). Thus, some translators might use \"And He called\" to reflect this possible original intent.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Why can you pick your eruv if one is his Rebbe Muvhak, according to R’ Yehuda?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>On the topic of making conditions on Eiruvei Techumin, Eruvin 3:5 rules:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>אִם בָּא חָכָם מִן הַמִּזְרָח, עֵרוּבִי לַמִּזְרָח. מִן הַמַּעֲרָב, עֵרוּבִי לַמַּעֲרָב. בָּא לְכָאן וּלְכָאן, לִמְקוֹם שֶׁאֶרְצֶה אֵלֵךְ. לֹא לְכָאן וְלֹא לְכָאן, הֲרֵינִי כִבְנֵי עִירִי. רַבִּי יְהוּדָה אוֹמֵר, אִם הָיָה אֶחָד מֵהֶן רַבּוֹ, הוֹלֵךְ אֵצֶל רַבּוֹ, וְאִם הָיוּ שְׁנֵיהֶם רַבּוֹתָיו, לִמְקוֹם שֶׁיִּרְצֶה יֵלֵךְ: </p>\n  \n  <p>[If a person makes a condition that] if a Chacham comes from the east, my Eruv should be [the one I set up] to the east; if he comes from the west, my Eruv should be to the west. If [a Chacham] comes from both directions, [my Eruv should be] whichever I want. If he doesn’t come from either direction, I’ll be like the people of my town [that is, no Eruv is valid]. R’ Yehuda says [regarding the case where a Rav comes from both sides], if one of them is his Rav, he goes to his Rav. If both are his Rav, he goes wherever he wants to go. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The Tiferes Yisrael notes that in the latter case of R’ Yehuda:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>אפילו אחד מהן רבו מובהק</p>\n  \n  <p>Even if one of them is his primary Rav</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>he can still go to whichever one he wants. </p>\n\n<p>Why should this be? Given that he’s presumably going to learn Torah, clearly R’ Yehuda paskens that if exactly one of them is his Rav, he goes to him because he’s going to learn Torah from <em>his</em> Rav - that’s who he learns Torah from. If one of them is his primary Rav, of course he would go to learn from him over the other guy, following the same logic! So why is the Eruv left up in the air, since we should be able to assume which one he would want ahead of time, just as in the first case?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>The gemara states (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Eruvin.36b.8?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Eruvin 36b</a>), as an explanation for the Rabanan's opinion:\nזִימְנִין דְּנִיחָא לֵיהּ בְּחַבְרֵיהּ טְפֵי מֵרַבֵּיהּ.</p>\n<p>I guess you can extrapolate to R' Yehuda's opinion that he concurs with the Rabanan to some extent, that \"זִימְנִין דְּנִיחָא לֵיהּ בְּחַבְרֵיהּ טְפֵי מֵרַבֵּיהּ\" - but R' Yehuda only accepts this argument <em>if both of them are his Rav</em>.</p>\n\n\n",

Do we say he gets to choose (as per the later clause - “if he/they come from both sides, my Eruv is whichever I wish”)? Do we say neither is valid, since they contradict?

The Selichot with the 13 Middot is like Shemoneh Esreh, and at the end of Selichot, they say Tachanun and end with Kaddish, similar to the main content of a Shacharit service.</p>\n\n<p>So, while I haven't yet found a source that specifically allows saying fast day Selichot before Shacharit, (see my comment above that implies that it looks like it's fine to do this. but I can't affirm it.) I'm inferring from this article that one would have to follow the format that is used during the Elul - Erev Yom Kippur Selichot, i.e. Ashrei, etc. I think the reasoning is general to all Selichot, not just this period.</p>\n\n<p>It's moreso that the common format of fast day Selichot occuring just prior to or in mid-Tachanun, has already taken care of the need for Ashrei. Your question, of course could be asked in reverse, namely, why aren't the Ellul Selichot said in the middle of Shacharit, instead?</p>\n\n\n",

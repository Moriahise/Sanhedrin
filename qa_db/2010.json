Is there a Chabad commentary on the Gemara?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 18)\n\n<p>There is a Chabad way of learning Gemara, as described by the Rebbe Rashab, the 5th Lubavitcher Rebbe and founder of Yeshivat Tomchei Temimim. In his <a href=\"http://www.sichos-in-english.org/books/the-tree-of-life-kuntres-etz-hachayim/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Kuntres Eitz Chayim</a>, he explains why it is necessary to learn Chassidus in addition to learning Gemara properly. The entire text is available online in English.</p>\n<p>From the <a href=\"http://www.sichos-in-english.org/books/the-tree-of-life-kuntres-etz-hachayim/01.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">introduction</a> to the english translation:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>There is, however, a possibility for negative consequences even within Torah study. Since the Torah is enclothed in worldly affairs and operates with the framework of human logic, it is possible that a person will look at it as no more than a system of wisdom, forgetting about G-d, the Giver of the Torah. When the Torah is studied with such an approach, it can become “a potion of death,” encouraging a person’s self-concern. Instead of serving as a tool to bring about the refinement of the world and the person studying, the study of the Torah can inflate the person’s ego and cause him to become more materially oriented.</p>\n<p>For this reason, it is necessary for one’s Torah study to include P’nimiyus HaTorah, the inner, mystic dimensions of the Torah, which focuses attention directly on the Torah’s G-dly and spiritual core.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The second half of the Sefer discuss the practical way Gemara should be learned.

The family did not accept Rav Bakst's opinion so he wrote his opinion to the Rebbe asking for his support in handling the parents. The Rebbe responded \"Misnagdishe Rav, Don't you know that the correct way to be learning is <em>girsadige</em>?! After all...

It triggered the first murder in the world through Kayin and Hevel, Yishmael needed to be sent away so as not to influence Yitzchak, Yaakov had to flee from an enraged Esav and then finally Yosef was sold by his brothers. The narrative is one of consistent opposition and conflict. It is only when we get to Parshas Vayechi, right at the end of sefer Bereishis that we see this trend amongst brothers come to an end.<sup>1</sup></p>\n<p>When presented to Yaakov Avinu for a bracha at the end of Yaakov’s life, Ephraim and Menashe do not react, let alone flinch, when Yaakov swaps over his hands and blesses Ephraim, the younger, with the bracha reserved for the bechor (firstborn). There is only a sense of togetherness with no iota of resentment. Explains <strong>Rav Yosef Yehuda Leib Sorotzkin</strong> in his <a href=\"https://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=51116&st=&pgnum=221&hilite=\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Meged Yosef</a> that it is specifically due to Ephraim and Menashe’s response that we mention their names in the bircas habanim ahead of any other tzaddikim from the Torah. Menashe could have been immensely jealous as he was overlooked and Ephraim could have quite easily displayed a boastful persona. Yet this was not the case. It was this mutual respect that they had for each other that set them apart. As he concludes:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"בראש ובראשונה אב רוצה לברך את בניו, שהשלום והאחוה ישרור ביניהם בהעדר גמור של קנאה וקפידא, כפי שהדגימו אפרים ומנשה שלא קנאו זה בזה, דאין יד שמאל מקנאת ביד ימין.\"</p>\n<p>“First and foremost, a father wants to bless his sons that the peace and brotherhood that exists between them should be completely devoid of jealousy and intolerance according to the example of Ephraim and Menashe who were not jealous of each other, that the one (under) the left hand was not jealous of the one (under) the right hand.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Another answer which has also been alluded to above (but not sourced) is brought in the Oznayim LaTorah by the Lutzker Rov, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zalman_Sorotzkin\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">HaRav Zalman Sorotskin zt\"l</a>, and is also mentioned in the Meged Yosef (see the next page in the link above) that despite being born in exile, they remained loyal to the Torah despite the Egyptian culture and environment. He writes there:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>לי נראה לבאר באופן אחר, מדוע כל אב בישראל מברך את בניו שהיו כאפרים וכמנשה. אף שאפרים ומנשה גדלו במצרים, מכל מקום הצליחו להתעלות עד שהיו ראויים להכלל בשבטי י-ה. זה לא יתכן אלא אם כן מיצו את כל כוחותיהם</p>\n<p>It seems to me to explain in a different way, why every father in Israel blesses his sons to be like Ephraim and like Menashe.

The following are some questions:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Where were the wicked that Chazal\nare referring to? </li>\n<li>How did Hashem separate it? </li>\n<li>Why don't the wicked deserve to use the light? </li>\n<li>How will it be used in the future?</li>\n<li>If we all have light, in what way did he hide it from the wicked? </li>\n<li>More to the point, what is the idea Chazal are trying to convey?</li>\n</ol>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 5)\n\n<p>The light referred to by this Midrash isn't light in its conventional sense, but rather a special \"light\" or \"sight\" that is some sort of spiritual energy. Here is an excerpt of the Midrash Rashi is citing:</p>\n\n<p>אור שברא הקב\"ה ביום ראשון אדם צופה ומביט בו מסוף העולם ועד סופו כיון שהסתכל הקב\"ה באנשי דור המבול ובאנשי דור הפלגה שמעשיהן מקולקלין, עמד וגנזה והתקינה לצדיקים לעתיד לבא </p>\n\n<p>To address your points:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Wicked people who arise in every generation.</li>\n<li>Separation in this context means \"put away for later.\"</li>\n<li>Because they're wicked and would harness the light to further their evil objectives.</li>\n<li>The worthy use the special light to see \"from one end of the world to the other.\"</li>\n<li>We all have regular physical light.

The brother-in-law responded that he went to do a bris milah on Shabbos, outside the land of Israel. How was the Ba'al Shem Tov able to do this? By using the light hidden in the Torah.

To many Rishonim such as the Rambam the idea of some action or vehicle of Mitzvah to bring about some \"magical\" outcome would be extremely problematic.  Even to suggest that by the performance of a Mitzvah you raise your level to merit a new Providential relationship to receive the desired outcome would be a stretch when applied to merely having some honor in assisting to do the Milah.  However, if the person believes that by being a Kvater it may help with their infertility the psychological impact might make a difference.  There have been many studies that have shown the relationship between the mind and the affects on the body.

If we tried it any other way, it would not work.” A person has to know that he belongs to the rest of his community before he can actually become part of it, and these outward signs allow him to do so.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>You could read into that what you will; I'd read into it that for the masses, adopting a complete brand is most effective.  But if some hybrid works for you, why not?  (The Rebbe didn't answer \"because keeping kosher is useless unless you wear a black hat!\")</p>\n\n<p>As for what to keep, I can refer you to Rabbi Moshe Feinstein's responsum whether someone who has worn traditional Polish Jewish garb who moves to America must maintain it; he writes that you should keep the <em>minhag</em> (customs) of your ancestors, but not their <em>chumras</em> (choices to be extra-strict); for instance (I would gather), if you accept R' Moshe's logic that chalav yisrael in America today is a <em>chumra</em>, then you wouldn't be bound by your family's adoption of that <em>chumra</em>.  Minhag would be more like whether to stand or sit for kiddush.  He also writes that in his (pointedly non-Hassidic opinion), the evolution of Hassidic garb was that a great rabbi chose to wear a long garment (considered more modest, and the sign of a scholar) and make it out of silk (to avoid prohibited mixtures of wool and linen); it wasn't that the rabbi made an enactment that his followers should follow his example, just that they chose to emulate him on their own.  (Rabbi Feinstein further argues that American clothing today is \"American Jewish garb\" and no worse than \"Polish Jewish garb.\")</p>\n\n<p>I'm sure there are still Hassidic groups that operate with very strict definitions of \"in\" and \"out\", but in today's world, more and more people find themselves in different ways; if the way that works for you to believe in G-d and Torah and keep 613 is by using Belz tunes, Lubavitch philosophy, and Lithuanian customs, at the end of the day I'd stay you're still a good Jew.  (But that's my opinion.)</p>\n\n<p>Now if you choose to hybridize legitimate streams of Orthodoxy, be aware that some people will be more okay with this than others, that it might be worth thinking about what practices to do publicly vs. privately, given your environment; and that some bridges are best not burned.  That's a path you have to find for yourself.</p>\n\n<p>Much <em>hatzlacha</em> (success) in your journey!</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>Chasidus strongly believes in keeping the Minhagim and dress of the previous generations. Thus someone that would not keep the Minhagim is not really being Chasidish. However there are different Chasidishe groups that dress in different manners (Lubavitch wears bend down hats, Stolin wears regular brim up hats, Bobov wears high beaver hats, Satmar wears low beaver hats). Thus you can be Chasidish in many different modes of dress if you follow the dictates of that particular Chasidus. </p>\n\n<p>My father always tells me that when the Torah talks about a murderer it is talking about a Frum Jew that has murdered someone. He does everything a Frum Jew does yet he went ahead and murdered someone. Thus there are people that may consider themselves Chasidish even if they are not doing everything 100% right.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>A person can be a Hasid without necessarily belonging to a specific group.

It does not mean that one can just pick and choose, rather one should be a thinker and adopt those practices that will help him in his service of Hashem and not adopt those practices which will hinder his service of Hashem.</p>\n\n\n",

However, there is a source for her not drinking from the Havdalla wine under the proper (or improper as the case may be) circumstances.  Obviously if she makes havdallah for herself (as is a custom in many communities) she must drink from the wine.  However, when she doesn't then it is better for her not to do so.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 9)\n\n<p>No. She will not grow a beard from drinking Havdalah wine. For an excellent article on this question and on whether she <strong>may</strong> drink from the wine read this <a href=\"http://hakirah.org/Vol%2010%20Zivotofsky.pdf\">article</a> by Rabbi Zivotofsky in the latest volume of Hakirah (Volume 10). It will be available in full for free when the next volume ships out.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 7)\n\n<p>I think I once heard as follows (hope the details are correct): There are questions about whether a woman is obligated in the brachah of \"Borei Meorei HaEish,\" and if not, her \"Amein\" after that brachah is considered an interruption after the brachah on the wine. It would thus be problematic for her to drink the wine without a new brachah. Since most people would not properly understand the particulars of this reasoning, there was just a blanket minhag that woman don't drink the havdalah wine. The beard thing was probably just an added \"incentive\" for those who might doubt minhagim, but would never mess with the spooky stuff. (That's my own theory, at least.)</p>\n\n\n",

      "content": "# May a Katan (minor) perform Melachah (\"work\") on Shabbath?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>In my experience, I've noticed that many people take for granted that if one needs a Melachah to be performed on Shabbath, one may have a minor, especially one under the age of 3, perform what is needed (eg., turning off a light left on in a bedroom Friday night).</p>\n\n<p>It's apparently not widely known that because of a question raised by Tosafoth (Shabbath 122a), the Magen Avraham (325:22) infers that one may not benefit from Melachah performed by a child who has been asked to do it. The Peri Megadim takes this a bit further and understands that it is a really big problem to ask a child to perform Melachah.</p>\n\n<p>But even the Peri Megadim, to the best of my knowledge, does not go so far as to ban the Hanaah (benefit) of Melachah performed by a child who does it on his own. This seems to parallel the Halachah of benefiting from Melachah performed by a gentile (and, indeed, this is, I believe, the generally accepted understanding - at least in my personal experience and limited research). </p>\n\n<p><em><strong>Would this not imply that the prohibition against having a child perform Melachah is of rabbinic origin? What about \"Atah UVincha UVitecha\" (Shemoth 20:9)?</em></strong></p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>If you have your own child do a melacha for you, this is certainly a violation of atta uvincha uvitecha and is worse than having a non-Jew (who is not your servant) do the melacha for you, which is only rabbinic.  The sugya which you bring is talking about a generic minor who does the melacha.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>Short answer: No. \n I believe that this is answered directly in the hakdamah of the Mishneh Berura to hilchot shabbat, and I know that it is answered in the Yalkut Yosef's Hilkhot Shabbat.  Essentially it is ossur to ask a non-Jew or a child to violate an issur d'oraitta under any normal conditions.  In general principle when there is a great amount of tzar or there is a sick person, that can be modified.  Though it would seem that is a Jewish child is never asked, but also is not reproached if they act under their own initiative.  See Magen Avraham 316 S\"K 17(also see Shmirat Shabbat K'hilchata chapter 30) for an instance of the issur of asking a non-Jew, and see the various Mishna Berura's brought on O\"H 316:11-12, where there are various instances of tzarei ba'alei haim that we would be unable to remedy, but we do not reproach a child who undertakes to help the animal of his own initiative.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 0)\n\n<p><a href=\"http://doseofhalacha.blogspot.co.uk/2016/01/ask-child-to-switch-lights-on-shabbos.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Dose of Halacha</a> writes that there are 2 issues - 'sefiyah' and 'chinuch'. He brings sources that allows you to have a young child (too young to understand) do melacha:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The Gemara (Sukka 42a) writes that parents are obligated to teach and train their children to do mitzvos before they become bar / bas mitzva. This obligation, chinuch, only applies when a child is old and mature enough to appreciate what they are doing and why. The Mishna Berura (128:123) writes that with regards to most mitzvos, the age is approximately 5 to 6.</p>\n<p>The Gemara (Yevamos 114a) writes that adults mustn’t feed children non-kosher food or make them do things that are forbidden on Shabbos. The Shulchan Aruch (OC 343:1) writes that this prohibition, known as sefiyah, also applies even if they are only forbidden miderabanan. Nonetheless, this only applies if the adult is specifically instructing the child to do the prohibition (See Mishna Berura 343:4).</p>\n<p>The Shulchan Aruch Harav (OC 343:10) writes, however, that one may give things to a young child on Shabbos even though you know that they will do something that is forbidden.</p>\n<p>Thus, R’ Yisroel Dovid Harfenes (Nishmas Shabbos 7:479) and the Piskei Teshuvos (343:2) write that one may stand a young child in front of a light switch on Shabbos even though they will switch it on or off, providing that they are too young to comprehend what they are doing.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

      "content": "# What is the Proper Way to Read Genesis 35:22?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>In Parshas Vayishlach, there is a verse (Genesis 35:22) that contains a \"Piska Be'emtza Pasuk\": a new paragraph in the Torah scroll begins in the middle of the verse. However, unlike with other examples of this phenomenon (e.g. Numbers 25:19), there are two versions of the trup (cantillation marks) given simulataneously, depending on whether the verse is read as one verse or two separate verses.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>וַיְהִ֗י בִּשְׁכֹּ֤ן יִשְׂרָאֵל֙ בָּאָ֣רֶץ הַהִ֔וא וַיֵּ֣לֶךְ רְאוּבֵ֗֔ן וַיִּשְׁכַּ֕ב֙ אֶת־בִּלְהָ֖ה֙ פִּילֶ֣גֶשׁ אָבִ֑֔יו וַיִּשְׁמַ֖ע יִשְׂרָאֵֽ֑ל וַיִּֽהְי֥וּ בְנֵֽי־יַעֲקֹ֖ב שְׁנֵ֥ים עָשָֽׂר</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The other places we have multiple note-choices printed per word are in the Decalogue, and we are assisted in teasing apart the טעם העליון and טעם התחתון (upper notes and lower notes) by handy printings in the back of the Chumash.</p>\n\n<p>When leining this, we are supposed to (I think) make it a single pasuk. Indeed, there are homiletical interpretations given for why this ought to be a single pasuk. In that case, I can see four possibilities for how to read it, given that the trup for the words ראובן and וישכב appear to be interchangable:</p>\n\n<p><strong>1:</strong></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>וַיְהִ֗י בִּשְׁכֹּ֤ן יִשְׂרָאֵל֙ בָּאָ֣רֶץ הַהִ֔וא וַיֵּ֣לֶךְ רְאוּבֵ֗ן וַיִּשְׁכַּ֕ב אֶת־בִּלְהָה֙ פִּילֶ֣גֶשׁ אָבִ֔יו וַיִּשְׁמַ֖ע יִשְׂרָאֵ֑ל\n  וַיִּֽהְי֥וּ בְנֵֽי־יַעֲקֹ֖ב שְׁנֵ֥ים עָשָֽׂר</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><strong>2:</strong></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>וַיְהִ֗י בִּשְׁכֹּ֤ן יִשְׂרָאֵל֙ בָּאָ֣רֶץ הַהִ֔וא וַיֵּ֣לֶךְ רְאוּבֵ֗ן וַיִּשְׁכַּב֙ אֶת־בִּלְהָה֙ פִּילֶ֣גֶשׁ אָבִ֔יו וַיִּשְׁמַ֖ע יִשְׂרָאֵ֑ל\n  וַיִּֽהְי֥וּ בְנֵֽי־יַעֲקֹ֖ב שְׁנֵ֥ים עָשָֽׂר</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><strong>3:</strong></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>וַיְהִ֗י בִּשְׁכֹּ֤ן יִשְׂרָאֵל֙ בָּאָ֣רֶץ הַהִ֔וא וַיֵּ֣לֶךְ רְאוּבֵ֔ן וַיִּשְׁכַּ֕ב אֶת־בִּלְהָה֙ פִּילֶ֣גֶשׁ אָבִ֔יו וַיִּשְׁמַ֖ע יִשְׂרָאֵ֑ל\n  וַיִּֽהְי֥וּ בְנֵֽי־יַעֲקֹ֖ב שְׁנֵ֥ים עָשָֽׂר</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><strong>4:</strong></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>וַיְהִ֗י בִּשְׁכֹּ֤ן יִשְׂרָאֵל֙ בָּאָ֣רֶץ הַהִ֔וא וַיֵּ֣לֶךְ רְאוּבֵ֔ן וַיִּשְׁכַּב֙ אֶת־בִּלְהָה֙ פִּילֶ֣גֶשׁ אָבִ֔יו וַיִּשְׁמַ֖ע יִשְׂרָאֵ֑ל\n  וַיִּֽהְי֥וּ בְנֵֽי־יַעֲקֹ֖ב שְׁנֵ֥ים עָשָֽׂר</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>always keeping in mind that if you use a note for the one-verse leining version, the other printed note must still be able to work properly for the two-verse version.

The first of Shevat is the new year for trees, according to Bais Shamai, however according to Bais Hillel the fifteenth of Shevat. Fruit trees use Tu Bishvat as the cut off date in the Hebrew calendar for calculating the age of a fruit bearing tree. The Halachos of Orlah remain to this very day in the same form it had in talmudic times and uses Tu B'Shvat in the same way. </p>\n\n<p>In the 16th century, the Arizal instituted that on Tu Bishvat we eat fruits from trees of Eretz Yisrael.

      "content": "# paying for an apartment\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>I recently came across an article describing the situation in Israel where in order to finalize an engagement, the parents have to pay for an entire apartment (not just a down payment, the whole price).  It also described the anguish involved, where parents must go into debt, or even move out of their own apartment to do this, and if they don't the shuidduch is canceled.</p>\n\n<p>My question is... is there a difference between different communities in this (i.e. Chabad, etc.).  The article said only that it affects the \"haredi\" (i.e. not Mordern Orthodox) communities, but I'm thinking maybe it's not <strong>all</strong> parts of the haredi community.</p>\n\n<p>If there are Chasidic groups that don't follow this, are there statements from the Rebbe that outline what should be done?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 6)\n\n<p>Tough question.</p>\n\n<p>There's a shiur on yutorah citing a responsum whether a grown child can pester his parents for money.  The halacha is that once a child is old enough to go out on their own (I believe the Israeli rabbinic courts will put that at 15 or 16), the parent has no hard-and-fast obligation to support them anymore, though continued support for their spiritual growth is considered meritorious (and counts towards charity tithes).  It is appropriate for a father to offer <em>some</em> kind of dowry so his daughter is more likely to get married, but that's a different discussion.  Thus the parents have no obligation to fund a grown child, so it's a violation of Halacha to emotionally pain your parents by pestering them.</p>\n\n<p>What happens today has nothing to do with halacha.  The sad truth is, who doesn't want to see their daughters happy/married/happily married?  And well, in a certain world in Israel, many guys won't consider your daughter unless you can buy him an apartment.  </p>\n\n<p>I've heard that the Gerrer Rebbe, showing fiscal leadership, has banned young couples from moving into apartments in the most expensive neighborhoods of Jerusalem and Bnei Brak, they need to start out in cheaper places; even if this couple could legitimately afford it, then the next couple could <em>almost</em> afford it, and before you know it, that's become the norm and expectation to which everyone is pushed.</p>\n\n<p>Unsurprisingly, in communities where people are working for a living, there's less need (and therefore less pressure) for the parents' buying an apartment; additionally, in communities where singles meet on their own, Baruch Hashem men and women meet and decide they like each other and want to get married, instead of holding anyone's lives up for ransom via complicated monetary arrangements.</p>\n\n<p>I've also heard (and again this is hearsay, pardon me if my language is strong here) that the Hassidic community in Israel has generally fared better in openness towards working for a living than the Ultra-Orthodox \"Lithuanian\" community.  The former understands it's a movement for the masses; the latter is still putting everyone through the grinder, trying to produce a handful of super-great scholars. </p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>My understanding from talking to people and learning in various Kollels here in Israel, is that it is primarily a Lithuanian Haredi thing, though some branches of Hassidic Haredim hold by the same practice, and it is not practiced at all in the Sephardi community.  </p>\n\n\n",

My basic reasoning for that is as follows.  I received semicha from the Israeli Rabbinute 10yrs ago, and soon after found myself in Kosher industry working for the OK.  I haven't been actively working in it for the last 5yrs, but I still receive the various trade publications.  What is considered the \"standard\" today, and what was considered the \"standard\" just ten years ago are vastly different.\n10yrs ago, no one had a problem with beer of any sort, excluding two European breweries that are run by monks and the proceeds go to fund their monastaries.  Today beer needs a hescher.  When certain agencies started giving hesherim to bottled water, bleach, and rat poison(which al pi halakha is quite interesting as it is a poison) everyone laughed.  Today every agency is doing it.\nI am not going to say CYLOR because quite frankly this may be a little over his head, however if you know a competent posek who does not have a hand in the Kashrut business, consult him.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 6)\n\n<p>My understanding is if there's flavoring, it will appear somewhere on the label, and if you see it on the label, it could be problematic.  (Occasionally the flavoring itself is just herbs and not a kosher problem, but there's no way for a consumer to tell what flavoring is in his \"flavored\" beer.)</p>\n\n<p>Here's the <a href=\"http://ecfr.gpoaccess.gov/cgi/t/text/text-idx?c=ecfr&sid=74b2057e6cc56612687175b4fdce8731&rgn=div8&view=text&node=27:1.0.1.1.20.6.326.4&idno=27\">US Government saying</a> that if you add anything other than the \"normal beer ingredients and processes\" (and if you're not sure what that means, ask them), you have to notify them with some extra paperwork; that's probably related to this issue.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>(a) For what fermented products must a formula be filed?

The gemara there suggest that this is obvious.  The gemara answers that it's not obvious since there is a pasuk of asher b'sar chamorim bisram,  however, we see it is erva from the pasuk of V'ervas avihem lo ra'u.</p>\n\n<p>We see from here that without the pasuk of inclusion, the body parts of an akum would not be an erva for kriyas shema despite having the exact same hirhur/erva-like issue. </p>\n\n<p>So, like Shalom and Isaac, the technical issue of erva doesn't exist.  </p>\n\n<p>However one can question why specifically kol isha gets included even though it isn't called erva, but arev (sweet).

He responded that in general, if what you can see causes thoughts that are incompatible with prayer, you shouldn't pray when you can see it. I'm not sure if your case violates the technical definition of proscribed nudity, but it may violate the more general, subjective, rule.</p>\n\n\n",

But if someone did slip up and forget and eat a yogurt an hour after their hamburger, the correct course of action is strategizing for the future, not guilt-tripping.  It's at most a mistaken violation of a custom, which requires no atonement (the Nesivos says violating a rabbinic commandment by mistake requires no atonement).</p>\n\n<p>Lastly, if you saw a nice yogurt and made a \"shehakol\", then suddenly realized <em>oy vey!</em> you ate a hamburger an hour ago, I've been told it's better to go ahead and take one taste (no more!) of the yogurt (assuming no other <em>shehakol</em> food is handy); better to violate the waiting custom than say a bracha for naught.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 8)\n\n<p>I once sat next to somebody on a flight to Israel (where our normal sense of time is probably even more distorted), and as soon as we were done the fleishig meal, he set the timer on his watch to make sure to wait the alloted time.

Shapiro</a>:<blockquote>\nThe fourteenth-century R. Eleazar Ashkenazi ben Nathan ha-Bavli...assumes that the extremely long lifespans found at the beginning of Genesis are not to be taken literally (p. 29).</p>\n\n<p>וימי חייהם אז היו כימי חיי אנשי דורנו לא פחות ולא יותר כי לא היו אז מזהירים כשמש ולא חזקים כנחושה, אבל היו מבשר ודם ומזרע אשה ומדם נדותה ככל אשר אנחנו עושים פה היום</p>\n\n<p>If people never lived so long, why were these number included in the Torah? R. Eleazar claims that Maimonides’ approach is to regard the lengthy lifespans as simple figures of speech, not meant to be taken literally any more than the statement that the Land of Israel was flowing with milk and honey or that the cities in Canaan were “fortified up to Heaven” (Deut. 1:28).[17]</p>\n\n<p>He also offers another explanation for the lengthy lifespans, namely, that the Torah recorded what the popular belief was, no matter how exaggerated, and Moses was not concerned about these sorts of things. In other words, just like today people say that the Torah is not interested in a scientific presentation of how the world was created, R. Eleazar’s position is that the Torah is not interested in a historically accurate presentation. In his mind, this has nothing to do with the Torah’s goals, and therefore there was no reason for the Torah not to present matters as they were believed at the time, even if these perceptions were inaccurate. The important thing, he says, is that the people would know that from the creation of the world until Israel stood at Sinai was close to three thousand years. This would help solidify belief in creation. The records of lifespans are just a means to illustrate this information.[18] He adds that when it came to events closer to Moses’ time, Moses was careful in preserving a more accurate accounting, while leaving the stories of the distant past cloaked in legend.</p>\n\n<p>There are other ways rationalists have dealt with the lengthy lifespans. For example, R. Nissim of Marseilles regards these years not as indicating an individual life, but rather the “lifespan” of the way of life (i.e., laws, customs) instituted by the figure in question, or the time until another one like him arose. He also assumes that when the Torah says that someone bore a son, it doesn’t have to mean a literal son. Here is what he writes in Ma’aseh Nissim, p. 274:</p>\n\n<p>יש מי שפירש שהכונה בחיים ההם קיום נמוסיו והנהגותיו הזמן [בזמן] הנזכר, בין בחייו בין אחר מותו. כי אלו, אפשר שהיו אנשי שם, מחקים חוקים ונימוסים, ומנהגים במידותיהם, גם במאכלם ומשתיהם ובמלבושיהם, ואחר הזמן ההוא אפשר שנשתכח הכל ובחרו דרך אחרת. או תאמר, שלא קם כמוהו עד זה הסך מן השנים במעלת ידיעת ההנהגה לבני דורו. ובזמן ההוא קם כמוהו במעלה, נמשך לדעתו וכונתו, ונחה רוחו עליו כאשר נחה רוח אליהו על אלישע. ואם לא ראה הראשון זה שקם אחריו ולא היה בזמנו, אפשר למד מספריו או התבונן בדבריו המקובלים, ועל זה כתוב: \"ויולד\" שהוליד בדמותו במעלה, כאלו הוא הוליד האיש ההוא מאשר הוא בעל הדעת ההוא שלמדוהו.‏</p>\n\n<p>In support of this approach, he refers to Va-Yikra Rabbah 21:9 which cites an opinion that Scripture intimated to Aaron that he would live 410 years. Although the Torah tells us that he only lived to 123 (Num. 33:39), the Midrash says that the righteous High Priests in the First Temple are called by Aaron’s name. In other words, they represent the spirit of Aaron, so in that sense it can be said that he lived so many hundreds of years. So too, R. Nissim thinks, when Scripture speaks of other people living so many hundreds of years it is to be understood in this fashion.</p>\n\n<p>Another approach was suggested by R. Moses Ibn Tibbon, who is quoted by R. Levi ben Hayyim.[19] According to Ibn Tibbon, the years given for people’s lives are actually the years of the dynasties they established.[20] (His other suggestion is the same as that of R. Nissim, mentioned above.):</p>\n\n<p>והחכם ר' משה פירש, כי כל אחד מאלו היה מלך או הניח נימוס, וכל זמן התמדת מלכותו ומלכות זרעו, או כל ימי המשכות נימוסו, קרא דור אחד, כאלו היה המלך או מניח הנימוס חי, וטעם \"ויולד בנים ובנות\" כי לאורך הזמן רבו ועצמו בני מלכותו או אנשי דתו, ושלחו קצתם אל ארץ אחרת.‏</p>\n\n<p>R. Levi ben Hayyim offers basically the same approach (p. 326):</p>\n\n<p>ונראה לי כי הדורות הנזכרים היו ראשי אבות, וזרע כל אחד נקרא בשמו כפי מספר השנים ההם. כי כל אחד, כמו שנאמר, הוליד בנים ובנות, כמו שנראה היום, עד שנשקע השם מהדורות הבאים אחריו, וקח מאתו זרע איש אחד מפורסם, וקראו בני זרעו ומשפחתו על שמו זמן מה, וכן התמיד עד שנתחדש דור אחר, נקרא [!] בניו ובני בניו על שמו [צ\"ל שם] חדש. והורה ספור הדורות ההם מאדם ועד זמן משה על חדוש העולם.‏</p>\n\n<p>[17] In Guide 2:47 Maimonides says that the people mentioned in the Bible who lived so long were exceptional in this respect, either because of their diet, mode of living, or due to a miracle. R. Eleazar obviously does not see this as reflecting Maimonides’ true view.</p>\n\n<p>[18] He writes (p. 30):</p>\n\n<p>ואל תתמה על זה ואל יקל בעיניך זאת התחבולה הנכבדת שנתכוון אליה כדי לאמץ האמנת החדוש . . . ולזה הוצרך ע\"ה לספר לנו חשבון השנים שעברו מזמן חדוש העולם עד זמננו, וזה היה עיקר גדול וצורך נפלא</p>\n\n<p>[19] Livyat Hen, ed. Kreisel (Beer Sheva, 2004), pp. 324ff. Here is the place to congratulate Howard Kreisel on the publication of the two volumes of Livyat Hen as well as R. Nissim of Marseilles’ Ma’aseh Nissim. As long as people study Jewish philosophy, they will use these editions. R. Joseph Kafih spent the last night of his life studying Ma’aseh Nissim. See Avivit Levi, Holekh Tamim (n.p., 2003), p. 226.</p>\n\n<p>[20] R. Eleazar Ashkenazi, Tzafnat Paneah, p. 29, cites this approach in the name of Ibn Ezra, but he does not tell us where it is to be found in Ibn Ezra’s Torah commentary or other works. </p>\n\n<p>אבל המשמע מדברי החכם ראב\"ע ז\"ל שהזקנים היו ראשי האבות לא שחיו המה כל כך\n</blockquote></p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 6)\n\n<p><em>Disclaimer:  I do not claim to \"know\" in any way what Hashem means concerning certain parts of the Torah, and there are strong sources for different approaches to both the Torah and Chazal.

Every modern survey and census of Jews in America has been performed with the <strong>widest</strong> possible definition of Jew, in order to obtain the fullest and least-controversial numbers.  This usually translates to counting someone as a Jew if they identify themselves as Jewish.  (<a href=\"http://www.jewishfederations.org/page.aspx?id=46185\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Source</a>)</p>\n\n<p>For example, a recent census, the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Jewish_Population_Survey\" rel=\"noreferrer\">National Jewish Population Survey 2000-01</a>, primarily counted someone as a Reform Jew if they <strong>considered themselves</strong> to be one.  The more stringent definition was simply those who are members or are affiliated with to a Reform synagogue.  (<a href=\"http://www.jewishfederations.org/local_includes/downloads/6262.pdf\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Source</a>)  Neither definition gets anywhere near \"Halakhic.\"</p>\n\n<p>The most recent census (as of this edit), the <a href=\"http://www.pewforum.org/2013/10/01/jewish-american-beliefs-attitudes-culture-survey/\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Pew Research - Portrait of Jewish Americans</a>, also used <strong>self-identification</strong> as their primary criteria.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>Even if one were to attempt to find out, they'd run into the following problems:</p>\n\n<p>Reform Judaism accepted Patrilineal Descent <a href=\"http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/Judaism/patrilineal1.html\" rel=\"noreferrer\">in 1983</a>.

However, Reform conversions are not performed to traditional halakhic standards, rending their children non-Jewish according to Halakha.</p>\n\n<p>Finally, even if the mother was halakhically Jewish, there are many problems with potential mamzeirut, as Reform Judaism does not conduct halakhically valid marriages and divorces.  While Mamzeirim <em>are</em> Jewish, they are many halakhic issues regarding their integration into the broader Jewish community, and thus any census of \"Halakhic Jews\" would have to include them as a separate category.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 11)\n\n<p>Non-halachic Reform Jews are those whose mother was not Jewish, yet they consider themselves Jewish because of either a heterodox conversion or patrilineal descent. We can mostly figure out the demographics from particular questions asked in certain surveys.</p>\n\n<p>According to the <a href=\"http://www.pewforum.org/2013/10/01/jewish-american-beliefs-attitudes-culture-survey/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">2013 Pew Study</a> on American Jews, <strong>10%</strong> of American adults who identify their religion as Judaism and their denomination as Reform say that their mother was not Jewish. (19% if you include those who consider themselves Jewish \"aside from religion\" and Reform, but we're going to focus on those who consider themselves associated with Judaism in some form.) Assuming that the percent of these people who converted Orthodox and later changed to Reform is negligible (which seems to be backed up by the data), we can assume that practically all of these individuals are not halachically Jewish.</p>\n\n<p>This gets more complicated when we consider the descendants of the female portion of that group. Any of the children who still consider themselves Reform Jews would say that they <em>do</em> have a Jewish mother, and the same for <em>their</em> descendants on the female line. How many people are there in this group?</p>\n\n<p>At the time of the survey, Reform Jewish women who say that their mother was not Jewish were 7.8% of the American (adult) Reform Jewish population. (Yes, the gender balance is massively skewed.) We have a fairly small sample size to work with for this group (less than 60 people), but we can get estimates of some basic points: 85% of the portion of the group with children have Jewish spouses or partners according to the respondent (38% are married to Jewish spouses overall), they have 0.8 children on average, ~1/3 of which are currently minors living in the respondents' homes, most of which are being \"raised Jewish\". About 55% of people raised Reform Jewish (regardless of whether they say their mother was Jewish) continue to identify as such as adults. Pew did not ask about the current religious affiliation of the respondents' adult children who don't live with their parents, so we'll have to rely on some educated guesses based off of what we know of Reform Jews in general.</p>\n\n<p>So, how many adult Reform Jews have mothers who self-identify as Reform Jewish but are not halachically Jewish? Without taking into account the considerable denominational switching between groups, the amount of Reform converts who were raised not Jewish by non-halachic Reform Jewish mothers but later started to identify with Judaism (Pew only asked those with no Jewish parents whether they had converted), or the differences in norms between generations, or the fact that many of the relevant mothers might be no longer alive, the group might be about <strong>2-3%</strong> of American Reform Jewry. There may also be a smaller group of third-generation descendants of these groups, but probably not enough to make a difference.</p>\n\n<p>So, approximately <strong>87%</strong> of adult Reform Jews in the United States are halachically Jewish.</p>\n\n<p>In Canada, according to the <a href=\"https://www.environicsinstitute.org/projects/project-details/survey-of-jews-in-canada\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">2018 Environics Institute survey of Jews in Canada</a>, <strong>93%</strong> of Canadian Reform Jews responded that their mother was Jewish. There is insufficient data available to determine the number of on second- or third-generation non-halachic Reform Jews. 16% of Canadian Jews identify as Reform, 98% of which identify their religion as Judaism.</p>\n\n<p>In Israel, according to the <a href=\"http://www.pewforum.org/2016/03/08/israels-religiously-divided-society/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">2015 Pew report</a> on the country, 3% of the Jewish population identifies as Reform.

Sometimes these aveiros become big in my mind and I can't concentrate on doing the other things.  I guess it feels like \"all or nothing\" and I feel like it would be better to not be frum at all.  How to fight this?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 15)\n\n<p>Here's one I know of.</p>\n\n<p>In the last mishnah of Yoma, R' Akiva says that \"just as a mikvah purifies the impure, so does Hashem purify Israel.\" The Lubavitcher Rebbe zt\"l <a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=16025&st=&pgnum=193\">points out</a> that the phrase \"the impure\" seems to be unnecessary; of course, those are the ones who'd be using a mikvah in the first place.</p>\n\n<p>And he explains: in halachah, a person can be tamei (impure) in various ways (for example, he might have come into contact with a corpse, and also with a dead animal's carcass, and also by being a metzora, etc.). Only some of these are purifiable via the mikvah; others require other procedures. Nevertheless, the mikvah is indeed effective in purifying this person from certain kinds of impurity.</p>\n\n<p>In the same way, then, he explains, R' Akiva means to say that Hashem is willing to act as a mikvah in this sense. Even if a person is not yet ready to do teshuvah for all of his or her misdeeds, Hashem will accept that person's teshuvah for what he or she is ready for, and forgive those - so that now they can start psyching themselves up to do teshuvah for the next thing, and onward.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 9)\n\n<p>I recommend that you take a look at the works of <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abraham_J._Twerski\">R' Dr. Abraham J. Twerski</a>. He's a rabbi with a very strong Chasidic heritage, a major psychiatrist, and a <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Abraham-J.-Twerski/e/B000APV2B6/\">prolific</a> author. Self-esteem is a very big theme in his books. I haven't read it, but one title that looks like it's aimed very close to the issue you're describing is <em><a href=\"http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/1578197988\">Angels Don't Leave Footprints: Discovering What's Right with Yourself</a></em>.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 9)\n\n<p>No person is completely free of sin (Kohelet 7:20). This does not prevent anyone from doing Teshuva, at least for those sins he's ready to abandon.</p>\n\n<p>Humans are referred to as \"mehalchim/moving\", as opposed to angels, who are referred to as \"omdim/standing\". Angels' spiritual level is frozen and cannot be altered. By contrast, humans are never standing still; rather, a human being is always moving, either upwards or downwards. God expects humans to strive to always move upwards; <strong>where</strong> exactly you are on the ladder is secondary.</p>\n\n<p>Rabbi Dan Segal explained a verse in tehillim \"זדים הליצני עד מאד מתורתך לא נטיתי\": sins I have committed intentionally pressured me, but I haven't strayed from your Torah. King David was tormented by personal failings but didn't let them deter him from Hashem's service. There is a well-known Chassidishe saying that the Yetzer Hara isn't after getting you to sin as much as getting you to feel depressed about it afterwards.</p>\n\n<p>Advice which has worked for many people (including myself): Instead of obsessing over the here and now, formulate a 12-month (or 5-year) plan in which you take upon yourself teeny little baby steps that move you away from a particular practice you wish to drop. Every move is a victory and should be celebrated. Eventually, with God's help, you'll get to where you need to be.</p>\n\n\n",

However, since the general public holds like the Mishnah Berurah instead, the footnotes are there to tell people how the Mishnah Berurah holds. Similarly, the new ArtScroll translation covers the opinions of modern poskim like R' Moshe Feinstein (who the general American public holds like). Similarly, in Israeli printings of the Kitzur Shulchan Aruch, you can find an appendix written by the Chazon Ish about halachot that apply only to Eretz Yisrael.</p>\n\n<p>(I do think that R' Mordechai Eliyahu's version of the Kitzur with footnotes from Ben Ish Chai has a different purpose. Since Sepharadim are very easily able to get their hands on a copy of the Ben Ish Chai, and it's not too much larger in Hebrew or English than the Kitzur is, there doesn't really seem to be a need to print the Kitzur Shulchan Aruch simply to make a comprehensive modern sefer of halacha avaialable. In this case, I think the point really is to be able to learn the psak of different poskim/eidot comparatively.)</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 5)\n\n<p>WAF, with lack of time in the day for 3 halacha sedarim.  Most will learn a sefer which is in line with their Yeshiva's path (commonly MB nowadays) or the Aruch haShulchan which provides good background and chidushim.  However, they would like to know if there are dissenting opinions among the other big Halachic rulers.  A quick footnote allows for that. </p>\n\n\n",
